0,Rainbow Rice,"Carrot ribbons (just use a peeler for speed)
Frozen peas
Red cabbage
Yellow peppers
Red onion1 tsp miso paste
1 tsp of Chinese five spice
2 tbsp of soy sauce
1 tbsp of oil
100g white rice","Cook the rice as instructed on the packaging.While the rice cooks, prep the vegetables. I like a mix of diced, ribbon, julienne to create a mix of textures.When the veg is ready, add the oil to a frying pan or wok and let it get hot before throwing in the veg. Carrots and cabbage take a little longer to cook so I put them in first and then the rest of the veg goes in a couple of minutes later.Keep giving the veg a stir and turning it over so it cooks evenly and doesn’t stick. It should take 5 – 10 mins to cook through.Add the miso, five spice and soy sauce and stir through. Finally, add the rice. Stir regularly so it doesn’t burn.

5,Chilli Vegetable Pizza,"125g ’00’ flour
125g strong wholemeal flour
1/2 tsp dried active yeast*
4g dried chipotle mora chilli
very finely diced
5g Himalayan pink salt (or table salt)
150ml warm water
12 cherry tomatoes
1/2 red onion
1 large clove garlic
7g ancho poblano chilli
soaked with seeds
1/2 cup water
2 tblsps balsamic vinegar","Makes 2 individual 8″ pizzas
EquipmentFood processor with dough blade
Pizza stone or tray
Measuring cups
Measuring spoons
Frying panAdd all of the flours, yeast*, salt and chipotle mora to the food processor with the dough blade and turn on.
*I only had dried active yeast to hand, so added it to the ingredients above, (ignoring the actual instructions on the container)with full success!
Pour the water in a steady trickle until you’ve used it all and the dough becomes a ball.
Take the dough out of the processor, lightly flour your surface and set the timer for 10 mins. Knead and stretch the dough the whole time – if your arms start to ache, just image the amazing workout you’re giving them without stepping inside a gym!
Once the timer goes off, shape into a ball, put into a deep bowl that’s had a light sprinkling of flour on the bottom, cover with cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Once rested, take it out of the bowl and knead again for 10 seconds – this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten.
Divide into 2 equally sized, smooth balls of dough and put into a deep baking dish, lightly sprinkled with flour. Make sure the dish is big enough for them to spread up to twice their size because as the gluten relaxes, they will spread to some degree.
* Top Tip *
I’ve made this base numerous times and sometimes the dough spreads a lot, other times it hardly spreads at all. Don’t worry, it’s always tasted great either way!
Leave to rest at room temperature overnight, or if you’re in a massive hurry, at least eight hours! I don’t leave mine in a very warm place like the airing cupboard as I found it can dry out and form a ‘skin’ on the outside.
* Top Tip *
The resting time for the dough is ideally 24 hours, but 48 hours is maximum.
Put the normal blade back into your food processor and add in the tomatoes, onion, garlic and ancho poblano, pulse for 10-20 seconds to break them up into small chunks, and pour into your frying pan.
* Top Tip *
You can choose how chunky or smooth to have the sauce when pulsing in the processor. Personally I prefer it chunky as it almost becomes one of the delicious pizza toppings.
Add the water, balsamic and simmer on a medium heat for 12-15 mins to let the flavours intensify, while stirring occasionally. It’s ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it’s still moist; don’t let it dry out and stick to the pan.
* Top Tip *
The sauce flavours will develop the longer you leave it, so why not make it a couple of days in advance and keep in the fridge? It does however, also tastes great if you make it on the day.
Turn the oven on to the highest setting to heat up your pizza stone if you have one, otherwise 220c if you’re using a pizza tray.
* Top Tip *
For pizza stones, it’s always the hotter the better, so I usually pre-heat mine for an hour.
Lightly flour your surface, roll out the dough, add sauce and your favourite tasty toppings. Put into the oven for approx. 8 mins on the pizza stone. I haven’t cooked them on a pizza tray before, but as it won’t have the intense heat of the stone, I’d suggest 10-12 mins (keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t overcook on top).
* Serving Suggestion *
These chilli pizzas are a spicy alternative to your usual takeaway version – the base has a delicious hot and smokey bite to it, yet this is balanced perfectly by the sweet flavours of the tomato sauce. Throw a pizza party and impress your friends with your cooking skills, or snuggle up on the sofa with your loved one and enjoy all to yourselves!
I honestly don’t miss cheese on pizza once I throw on a mix of veggies, Dee’s vegan sausage and lots of hot, sweet roquito peppers – what’s on your list of ultimate pizza toppings?

30g dairy-free soya spread
3 tbsp agave nectar or maple syrup
25g plain gluten-free flour
50g ground almonds
3 Nākd Bakewell Tart Bars
Flaked almonds, for decorating","Serves: 20
Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus 15 minutes chilling
Cooking time: 15 minutesHeat the oven to 170c and lightly grease a mini muffin tin.
Make the pastry by sifting the flour into the bowl of a food processor and adding the soya spread. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Alternatively, mix together in a bowl using your fingertips. Transfer the mixture to a separate bowl and stir in the agave nectar/maple syrup and a small amount of water at a time until a smooth dough comes together. Wrap it in cling film and leave in the fridge for 15 minutes, whilst you prepare the filling.
Make an almond Frangipane by creaming the dairy-free spread and agave nectar/maple syrup together, then adding the gluten-free flour and ground almonds, mixing until well combined.
Once the dough has chilled, roll it out between two sheets of cling film to about 1/4cm thickness. Use a cookie cutter or upside down glass to cut out pastry shells to fit into the mini muffin tin.
Start filling the shells with bits of the Nākd Bakewell Tart bars, by rolling them into small discs to fill the bottom of the shell, coming up a third of the way.
Spoon the Frangipane mixture on top and flatten with your finger to create a smooth top. Decorate with the flaked almonds and brush the tops with a little dairy-free milk.

9,Non-Dairy Garlic Herb Gournay,"½ block (7 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu (not silken tofu)
3 tbsp organic refined coconut oil
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp white wine vinegar or raw apple cider vinegar
1 to 2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tsp dried parsley
2 tsp dried minced chives
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp fine sea salt or kosher salt
½ tsp onion powder
½ tsp coarse ground black pepper
¼ tsp dried thyme leaves
Plain unsweetened non-dairy milk to adjust consistency as needed*","*Homemade almond or cashew milk is ideal because of its creamy consistency and ability to minimize the chalky undertaste of the tofu.
Press the tofu to remove as much moisture as possible and then crumble into a food processor.
Remove the metal lid from the jar of coconut oil and place the jar in a microwave. Heat just until the solid oil liquefies, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (this will depend upon the solidity of the coconut oil). Alternately, place the jar in about an inch of simmering water and melt the oil in the same manner. Measure 3 tablespoons and add to the food processor with the remaining ingredients. Process the contents until very smooth.
Transfer the mixture to a container with a lid. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 6 hours to allow the flavors to blend and the cheese to firm. If desired, transfer the cheese to a decorative container and allow the cheese to soften for about 15 minutes at room temperature before serving. Gournay should be thick, yet spreadable. If the cheese is dry and crumbly, stir in small amounts of non-dairy milk until the desired consistency is achieved.

14,Butternut Squash and Sage Lasagne,"For the butternut ‘pasta’:
1 butternut squash
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp maple syrup
8 sage leaves (fresh)
Black pepper
For the tomato sauce:
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp cinnamon
6 cloves garlic
1 red chilli
1 red onion
250g chestnut mushrooms
4 medium tomatoes (you could also use a tin of chopped tomatoes; cooking time will be less)
2 tsp red pepper / tomato puree
125 ml red wine
1 tbsp vinegar (red wine or balsamic)
Black pepper
For the white sauce:
1 tsp olive oil
3 cloves garlic
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp cumin
1 tbsp coconut flour
125 ml non-dairy milk
350g silken firm tofu
1 tbsp lemon juice
3 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
Himalayan pink salt, to taste
250g baby spinach
2 vegan sausages (such as Field Roast, Chipotle flavour) sliced into thin discs
Handful of grated vegan cheese","Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
To prepare the butternut, begin by peeling with a sharp knife. I find the easiest way to do this is to first slice off the ends, followed by cutting it in half across the middle. You can now slice the skin off from top to bottom on each half. Once peeled, cut each half lengthways through the middle and scoop the seeds and stringy bits from the bottom half. Now slice each segment thinly, so you have lots of half crescent ‘pasta’ sheets.
Lay the butternut slices on an oven tray and drizzle over the olive oil and maple syrup. Chop the sage leaves into 1cm wide ribbons and sprinkle these on with some black pepper. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes.
While the butternut slices are cooking, prepare the tomato sauce. Finely chop the red onion, garlic and chilli and chop the mushrooms into quarters. Heat the olive oil on a medium heat in a large pan and add the spices: cooking these first releases the flavours. Add the onion, garlic, chilli and mushrooms and cook for about 10 minutes (or when slightly browned and soft).
Chop the tomatoes into small chunks and add these to the pan with the pepper/tomato paste, red wine and vinegar. Simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until reduced. It should be thick, but still loose. Add the black pepper towards the end of cooking.
While the tomato sauce is reducing you can make the white sauce. Heat the olive oil on a medium heat in a saucepan and add the spices and garlic. Keep an eye on the garlic – you want it to brown lightly but not burn. Once the garlic has begun to colour stir in the flour – much like making a roux for a béchamel sauce. Stir for a minute and then add the milk to create a sauce, continuing to stir. Next, add the tofu and mash it into the sauce using the back of the spoon. You can now stir in the remaining ingredients and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Again, it should be thick but loose.
Finally, wilt the spinach by putting it in a pan on a low heat. Give it a stir and drain the water- this only takes about 5 minutes.
Now for the assembly! Layer the ingredients in a deep dish or tin. I put mine together in the following order: tomato sauce, white sauce, spinach and sausage slices, butternut squash. Repeat until you have used all the ingredients and finish with a sprinkling of cheese.
Cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the top is nice and crisp. Let it stand for 5 minutes before serving, so that the layers hold their shape.
Wonderful! Serve with steamed greens and a Miso dressing, which work really well as a contrasting tang to all of the earthy flavours of the lasagne.Love this recipe?

15,Shepherd’s Pie,"8-10 potatoes peeled
2 medium onions
2 large carrots
10 button mushrooms (or equivalent)
4 stalks of celery
2 garlic cloves
200g brown or green lentils (dry)
2 tbsp fresh parsley
1 big teaspoon of mixed herbs (feel free to use more if you want)
½ – 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (yes you read right – cinnamon)
1 tbsp plain flour
1 tbsp soya butter
1 tbsp tomato puree
1 vegetable stock cube
500ml boiling water
Salt and pepper","Soak your lentils in advance (2/3 hours before cooking ideally).Soak your lentils in water for 2/3 hours before you start cooking. If you don’t do this they will take a lot longer to cook.Peel, wash and put your potatoes on to boil.Finely dice your onions, carrots, celery and mushrooms and crush your garlic.Put a casserole pot on a medium heat and add your soya butter.When melted add the onions and sweat them off until they start to go translucent.Add the garlic and sweat until both the onion and garlic are soft and translucent.Add the rest of the veg and cook for another 10 minutes – stirring constantly.When the veg has softened and started to brown add in your flour and stir through so it coats the veg.Then add the flavourings – salt, pepper, cinnamon, mixed herbs and parsley. Stir these through.Make 500ml of stock using your water and vegetable stock cube.Mix the tomato puree into the stock.Then start adding your stock to the veg very slowly. Every time your pour some stock into the veg stir it through until it has absorbed and slightly thickened.Then drain your lentils and them to the pot and stir through.If this makes the mixture too dry add some more boiling water in small amounts. If you need to add a lot of water you can throw in another half a stock cube so you don’t dilute all the flavour.Leave the mixture to simmer for around 40-45 minutes but check it and stir it constantly to make sure it doesn’t burn. Keep the heat low to avoid this happening.Add in a about a tablespoon of brown sauce at the end of the cooking process and stir it though.When the lentil mix is cooked through add it to your baking dish.Mash your potatoes with soya butter and unsweetened soya milk or another plant milk (I would not recommend anything sweet or almond milk).Spread the mashed potato over the top of the lentil mix, smoothing it out with a fork. We added some parsley on top.If you have any Violife cheese you could add this over the top but that is optional.Then bake the shepherd’s pie a hot oven for 20-30 minutes until the potato starts to go golden brown. If you don’t bake it until the following day it will need longer.When it’s ready put your hands together and give thanks that NO animal was harmed in the making of your dinner and enjoy!Like this recipe?

They should both be soft and well coloured. Deseed the pepper, trim the aubergine, and roughly chop them both.While that is going on, on a medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan. Add the onions and fry for 6–8 minutes, then add the garlic, mushrooms, spices, salt and pepper, and continue cooking for 3–4 minutes. Add a splash more oil if needed. Now add the red pepper and aubergine, with the basil and tomatoes, and warm through on a low simmer for 6–7 minutes more. Stir in the parsley, cover and keep warm.Your oven should still be rocking. Bring it back to 200°C/gas mark 6, lay out your flatbreads on baking trays and brush them with olive oil (especially the edges). Spread the vegetable mixture thinly over the bread – 4 tablespoons per lakmajun is normally cool. Top with cashews and tofu feta (if you’re using it) and pop into the oven for 12–15 minutes.Serve drizzled with a little more olive oil and even a little squeeze of lemon juice. Depending on the size of the flatbread, this dish makes a great little or big plate and can be cut into wedges to be served as an appetizer or rolled around some salad. Raw cashew hummus (see page 160) is a perfect accompaniment.Like this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.

20,Hot Cross Buns,"1tbsp ground flaxseed
300ml plant-based milk
50g vegan margarine
500g strong bread flour
1tsp salt
75g caster sugar
1tbsp sunflower oil
7g sachet fast-action yeast
75g sultanas
50g mixed peel
zest of 1 orange
1 apple, peeled, cored and finely chopped
1tsp ground cinnamon
75g plain flour
3tbsp apricot jam","Make a flax egg by combining 1tbsp ground flaxseed with 3tbsp warm water. Give it a good whisk and let it stand for 15 minutes.
Bring the plant-based milk to the boil, then add the vegan margarine. Leave it to cool just enough that you can comfortably dip a finger in. Put the bread flour, salt, sugar and yeast in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in the warm milk mixture, then add the flax egg. Mix well with a wooden spoon, then bring everything together with your hands until you have a dough.
Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes. You want the dough to look smooth and elastic. Put the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with oiled cling film or a clean tea towel. Leave it to rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size.
Tip in the sultanas, peel, orange zest, apple and cinnamon. Knead the fruit into the dough. Cover again with cling film or a tea towel and let it stand for another hour.
Divide the dough into about 15 pieces and roll each one into a ball. Arrange the buns on a lined baking tray leaving room between each one so it can expand. Cover and let them stand for another hour.
Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Mix the plain flour with 5tbsp water and mix into a dough. Pinch off lumps of this dough and roll into long strips. Drape these over your buns in a cross shape. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the buns are golden-brown on top.
Heat the jam until it melts. Take the buns out of the oven and spread the hot jam on top to make a glaze. Leave them to cool.Want more delicious recipes?

24,Chocolate Fudge Cake,"260g self-raising flour
40g cocoa powder
2 teaspoons of baking powder
1/2 teaspoon of salt
200g golden caster sugar
200g dairy-free spread (I use Pure Sunflower Spread)
200g plain, dairy-free chocolate (70% or more)
400ml sweetened soya milk (I used the blue Vive Soy as it has a beautiful vanilla flavour to it)
1 tablespoon of vanilla extractGanache filling & topping:100g plain chocolate (70% or more)
100g icing sugar
160ml tin of coconut cream
1 tablespoon of vanilla extract
1 tablespoon of dairy-free spread","For the cake:Pop the oven on to 180 degrees centrigrade
Grease two 8 inch cake tins (I recommend you use springform tins if you can as these sponges have a delicate structure)
Mix the flour, cocoa powder, salt baking powder together in one bowl and set to one side
Melt the plain chocolate and whisk together with the dairy-free spread, caster sugar, soya milk, & vanilla extract
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix with a metal spoon only until they are combined. Warning – don’t use an electric whisk and don’t mix any longer than absolutely necessary – I really mean it when I say just enough to ensure the ingredients are combined. Any lumps will work themselves out in the oven. If you’re new to egg-free baking then this may seem counter-intuitive but unlike traditional baking, you want to keep air out until the cakes are in the oven.
Tap the bowl on the work surface to knock any air out of the mixture
Spoon equally into each of the cake tins
Tap each cake tin on the work surface to knock out any air you can
Place the tins in the oven for 20-25 minutes depending on your oven
Remove from the oven & test with a knife to ensure fully cooked
Leave to cool as they are for 5-10 minutes then remove the sides of the tin & leave to cool entirely
You should find that the sponges level off quite nicely so there’ll be no need to slice off the top of one but if you need to, do so with careFor the Ganache:Melt the chocolate, coconut cream, and dairy-free spread over a low heat
Sift in the icing sugar and stir in gently until you have a smooth, glossy mixture
Leave to cool enough to be firmer but not too firm so you can still pour over the top of the finished cake
Spread some of the ganache onto the bottom sponge and gently place the second sponge on top
Once the ganache has cooled enough, pour over the cake, using a knife to spread it evenly around the sides.
Garnish as you fancy, I did so with mixed berries as you can see!Tip: Decorate the cake on a plate so that any excess ganache is caught. You may find it helps to pop it in the fridge to firm up the ganache so you can go back over with a knife to improve the presentation on the sides. If you’re a real perfectionist when it comes to presentation (which I wasn’t on this occassion), a knife warmed under the hot tap will help you to achieve a smooth & glossy finish when finishing off the sides).

27,Lemon Tart,"For lemon pastry:
230g/8oz Gluten Free Plain Flour
60g/2oz dairy-free margarine – Pure Sunflower Spread
60g/2oz vegetable shortening
2 tbsp caster sugar
½ tsp xantham gum
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 – 2 tbsp cold water
The zest of 1 lemon
For the filling:
3 tbsp agar agar flakes
150g caster sugar
160ml lemon juice 
3 tbsp cornflour 
The zest of 2 lemons
60ml oat cream","Serves 12
You will need a deep 8 inch tart tin with removable base for this recipe.
Place the flour, xantham gum, margarine and vegetable fat in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is of a breadcrumb like consistency. Add the lemon zest and caster sugar and pulse for another minute. Tip in the lemon juice and 1 tbsp of cold water, pulsing as you go, until the mixture begins to pull together to form a dough. You can then add the extra water if you think it needs it. Turn the pastry in to a large bowl and, using the tips of your fingers, pull together into a ball. Knead lightly for 2 minutes until smooth and elastic to your touch. Lay the pastry between two large layers of clingfilm and roll it out – ensuring that the pastry becomes no thinner than 3mm. Peel off the uppermost layer of clingfilm and turn the pastry in to its tin, filling in any cracks or gaps that may appear with extra pastry, patted flat with your fingertips.
Preheat the oven to 200c. Blind bake the lemon pastry for 30 minutes, after 15 minutes remove the parchment and baking beans from the pastry and return to the oven for the remaining cooking time. Once the pastry is cooked and lightly golden, remove from the oven and set aside to cool down.
Place the agar flakes in a high sided saucepan with 330ml of water. Bring to the boil and leave to boil gently for 10 minutes, whisking every now and then until the agar has dissolved. Don’t worry if the liquid foams up, this is normal and why you need to use a high sided pan. Add the sugar to the liquid and continue to boil gently, whisking occasionally, for 3 – 4 minutes or until the sugar has dissolved into the liquid, then remove from the heat.
In a separate bowl, combine the lemon juice, zest and cornflour and stir together until smooth. Add this mixture and the oat cream to the agar liquid and whisk together constantly, over a medium heat, for around 5 minutes or until the mixture thickens and becomes syrupy. Take off the heat and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Pour the lemon filling into the pastry tart, leave to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes and then place in the fridge to set for 1 hour.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lemon-Tart-400x600.jpg,4,310

So, just a quick tip for all pomegranate newbies – cut the pomegranate into segments and de-pip by hand in a bowl of water. The pith will float and the seeds will sink. Pour the pith and water out and you will be left with the seeds.)

Garnish with some fresh coriander.Dashi Stock
An essential ingredient in macrobiotic dishes and Japanese cuisine; an earthy flavoured stock made from kombu soaking water. It’s a great base for soups, stews, sauces, noodle broths and dips. Usually dashi is seasoned to taste with a generous serving of shoyu (natural soy sauce). Often mirin is also added, plus a little juice squeezed from a piece of grated ginger root.
To prepare a basic dashi:
Soak a six inch piece of kombu and three dried shitake, or maitake, mushrooms in about 10 cups of water for at least 15 minutes.
Remove the mushroom, and thinly slice the caps. Discard the root as it can be bitter tasting.
Return them to the water, bring it to the boil and simmer gently for 10 minutes.
Remove the kombu and keep it to use for cooking, as a condiment, or with beans.

5 tablespoons plain flour
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
½ pint almond milk
2 Beyond Meat patties
2 tablespoons Belazu smoked semi-dried tomatoes
2 slices of Violife vegan cheddar cheese
Salt & pepper to taste","First, prepare the aubergine: sprinkle the discs lightly with salt and leave for 30 minutes to 1 hour before patting dry with kitchen paper. Heat a grill pan or griddle on high, then toss in the aubergine slices with the olive oil. Grill until browned, roughly 3-5 minutes on each side.
Set the aubergines aside and prepare the courgette: wash, pat dry and trim the courgettes. Cut into thin chips, place in a bowl, sprinkle with salt and mix thoroughly. Then add almond milk enough to cover courgettes. Leave for 30 minutes, so they have time to release any bitter juices. If you have a deep-fat fryer, heat the oil to 180°C. If not, choose a sturdy deep saucepan with jam thermometer clipped to the side, or alternatively heat to medium low.
Pour the plain flour into a large mixing bowl. Season with a good sprinkle of salt and black pepper, and the cayenne pepper. Drain the milk from the courgettes, then toss the courgettes into the flour until they’re lightly coated. Fry for 2–3 minutes, or until golden and crisp, then tip on to crumpled kitchen paper to remove any excess oil.
Next, reheat the grill pan or griddle and grill the Beyond Meat patties until browned, roughly 2 minutes on each side.
Finally, build your burger: spread the bottom half of your sliced brioche or ciabatta with a thick layer of the mustard mayo. Add rocket, followed by the tomato, onion, grilled aubergine, Beyond Meat Patty, Violife cheddar, smoked semi-dried tomatoes and lastly the crispy courgettes. Top with the second half of the bun, press down lightly and serve immediately.Did you like this recipe? Try the Beyond Double Decker Burger too!

When using melted coconut oil in any recipe with oat milk, it’s important to use room temperature milk and also slowly mix in the two when combining. If you use cold plant milk, it will cause the coconut oil to go back to its natural state and, you’ll have to re-melt the whole mixture in the microwave.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image009-400x599.jpg,10,390

1 8oz package 3 grain tempeh
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon liquid amino acids (we use Bragg’s)
1 ½ teaspoons fennel seeds
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black peppercorns
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
¼ teaspoon celery seed
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
Dashes liquid smoke
1 clove garlic-minced
Black Pepper Cheezy Polenta:
4 cups water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup corn meal
2 pinches crushed black peppercorns
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
Other Ingredients:
1/4 cup white wine
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons liquid amino acids (we use Bragg’s)
1 large red onion, diced small
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (we used heirloom cherry tomatoes, but you don’t have to)
1 red bell pepper, chopped into bite sized pieces
1 cup raw baby spinach leaves
5 large fresh basil leaves, cut small","In a large bowl, toss all the ingredients for the tempeh sausage. Cover and let marinate while you make your polenta.
In a Dutch oven or another large pot, bring 4 cups of water, olive oil and salt to a boil. Gradually add your corn meal to the boiling water using a whisk to blend it in. Try to break up any clumps you see start to form. Once all your corn meal is added, whisk in your pepper and nutritional yeast. Then move to stirring your polenta with a wooden spoon, be sure to scrap the sides and bottom of the pot while you stir. You’re going to be stirring pretty much continually while your polenta thickens for about 40-45 minutes.Polenta is a needy dish.
Once your polenta is soft but firm – you’ll know what I mean, put a lid on top . Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in your deepest skillet over a medium heat. Once your oil is hot, toss in your tempeh sausage mix, white wine, liquid amino acidsand onions, and cook while mixing with a spatula until your tempeh has slightly crispy edges. Then toss your tomatoes and bell peppers in and let them cook for about 5 minutes, flipping them every once in a while to make sure they’re cooking evenly. Once your peppers are tender, mix in your spinach and basil leaves. Once they’re wilted, you’re done!
Serve your tempeh sausage & heirloom tomatoes over your polenta – being sure to get some of the thin “sauce” on the bottom of the skillet.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_6759-Version-3-400x533.jpg,15,623
60,Baked Buckwheat with Tomatoes,"250 gr. Buckwheat (whole seeds)
½ stick vegan butter or margarine (plus some extra for greasing the pan)

1 teaspoon curcuma
1 teaspoon dried majoram
¼ cup dried parsley
1 bunch spring onions (6-7)
5 large tomatoes (or beef tomatoes if you have)
½ cup homemade cashew parmesan
½ cup marinated tofu
For the marinated tofu:
1 package firm tofu (makes 1.5 cups tofu cubes after pressing)
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 cup olive oil
3-4 garlic cloves
½ teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt","Prepare the marinated tofu first, a couple of days ahead wouldbe even better. I always have a jar of this at home, it adds alittle oomph to a lot of dishes.
Tofu:Remove the tofu from the package and press it between severallayers of paper towels. While pressing the tofu, whisk thelemon juice with salt, pepper and olive oil until the mixtureturns into a smooth emulsion. Cube the dried tofu and fill thecubes in a jar. Peel the garlic cloves , cut them in halveslengthwise and add them to the tofu. Pour the lemon and oliveoil mixture over the tofu cubes so they’re completely coveredand close the jar with a lid. Shake the jar a little. Setaside, but not in the fridge, to let the tofu marinate. Shakeoccasionally to keep everything evenly covered and let itmarinate as long as possible. This get’s more zingy the longerit sits.
Cashew Parmesan:Mix 1 cup roasted and salted cashewswith 1/3 cup nutritional yeast and 1 teaspoon of Shiro Miso ina blender until the mixture has the texture of gratedparmesan. If you use unsalted cashews, add a teaspoon of saltto the mixture. I recommend you double or triple the recipe,it keeps in the fridge and you’ll want to use it in otherdishes, too.
Roast the buckwheat with half of the vegan butter or margarinein a pot. Add the broth, curcuma, majoram and parsley. Closethe lid and let the mixture simmer on small heat for 15minutes.
Preheat oven to 200C/390F.
Turn off the heat under the buckwheat and let it soak foranother 10 minutes. Meanwhile, clean the spring onions, topand tail and cut them in fine rings. Scald and peel thetomatoes and remove the core. Grease an oven-proof casseroledish and place the tomatoes top down in the dish. Mix springonions, buckweat and cashew parmesan and distribute themixture evenly around the tomatoes.
Crumble the marinated tofu with a fork, mix the crumbles with2 tablespoons of the marinade and sprinkle the dish with thetofu and marinade mixture.
Bake for 30 minutes at 200C/390F.
Serve with tomato and cucumber salad and soy yogurt or vegansour cream.

1 red onion
4 cloves garlic
1 tin pinto beans (400g / drained weight 240g), rinsed and drained
1 medium tomato
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp smoked paprika
2 tsp good soy sauce or aminos
For the peach salsa:
1 avocado
4 saturn peaches or 1 regular peach
2 medium tomatoes
Juice of 1 lime (preferably organic)
Handful of fresh coriander stems & leaves
4 romaine or gem lettuce leaves","Make the socca batter by sifting the chickpea flour into a bowl. Combine with the water by hand-whisking (using a fork is fine) to ensure there are no lumps and it’s nice and bubbly. Set aside.
Place the chipotle chilli in a bowl with boiling water and set aside.
To make the salsa, chop the avocado, peaches and tomatoes into small chunks and combine in a bowl with the lime juice and finely chopped coriander.
Cut the lettuce into fine ribbons and place in a bowl.
Remove the chipotle chilli from the water and remove the seeds and membrane (if you don’t do this your mouth will be on fire!). Finely chop the rest.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan while you chop the onion, garlic and tomato. Add these and the chipotle to the pan and cook until the onions become translucent – about 5 minutes. Add the cumin and paprika, give it a stir and then add the pinto beans. While this is cooking you can make the socca tacos.
Place a good, non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, adding a little oil if needed (see note). Once the pan is hot, spoon in some of the socca batter. I find a large serving spoon is about the right amount – making about 6 tortillas.
Wait for bubbles to appear in the batter. Once they have all popped, flip the tortilla over and allow the other side to cook – about 2 minutes on each side.
Pop them on a plate ready to serve.
The hot filling will also be ready by now, transfer this to a serving bowl.I like to serve these by setting out all the dishes on the table for a DIY dinner – it’s much more fun!
NOTES:I recently acquired a ceramic frying pan which is perfect for this recipe. You can make pancakes – and everything else – without the need for a single drop of oil! If your pan is not super non-stick, use a little oil for the socca, as you would for regular pancakes.If you don’t want to be cooking the hot filling and the socca tortillas at the same time, make the tortillas first and set aside on a plate – they don’t need to be hot to serve.I’ve suggested using organic limes because not only do they taste great, but they are unwaxed (which is particularly important if you’re using the zest).

88,Grilled Vegan Feta on Summery Watermelon and Caper Salad,"Vegan feta cheese ingredients:
75g unsalted cashew nuts
150ml water
1/2 cup corn starch
3 1/2 tbsp nutritional yeast
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
Other ingredients:
Watermelon slices
Capers
Thinly sliced red onion
Mint or rocket leaves
Olive oil","Add all vegan feta cheese ingredients into a blender (no need to soak the cashews) and blend until you get a smooth cheese sauce.
Then pour it into a pan and heat up to high to medium heat. Stir continuously so it doesn’t burn. Slowly the sauce will turn into a thick paste. Once it has reached a paste-like consistency keep cooking for another 2-3 minutes as the starch needs to be fully cooked. If you don’t cook it long enough you might taste the starch.
Transfer the paste into a tupperware dish and even it out with a spoon. Keep it in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours (or in the freezer for 1.5+ hours) until it has set completely.
Then cut off slices and sauté the cooled down slices (don’t take it out fo the fridge hours before, it works best when they are cool) in a griddle pan on both sides until it turns crispy and you can see the burn marks.
Serve on a plate on top of a melon and add some capers as well. Garnish with either mint or rocket leaves. Drizzle some olive oil over it for some extra deliciousness (not necessary if you are looking to reduce calories). Enjoy!

½ cup (10 to 12 leaves) chopped basil","Heat the oil or water in a soup pot over medium-high heat for just about 1 minute. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic, and cook for about 10 minutes until all the veggies begin to soften. Stir occasionally.
Add the eggplant and water, and cook, covered, until the eggplant is slightly softened, about 10 minutes.
Add the canned tomatoes with their juice, potatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, bay leaves, thyme, oregano, parsley, and tarragon. Stir, then reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are soft. (If water/broth evaporates while the vegetables are still cooking, add a little extra.)
Stir in the salt and pepper, along with the chopped basil. Serve immediately with a hearty, rustic loaf of bread.For Your Edification
Mirepoix is a mixture of chopped onions, carrots, and celery, and to reduce some prep time, you can often find pre-chopped mirepoix in such grocery stores as Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods (USA only).
For Your Modification
Add your favorite vegan Italian sausage, such as Field Roast or Tofurky, to the stew at the end. I think for maximum flavor and texture, you will want to slice the sausage(s) into discs, fry them in a little olive oil, then add them to the soup in the last 10 or 15 minutes of cooking.

102,Vegan Chilli,"1 white onion
3 cloves of garlic
Salt
Paprika
A chilli pepper – your choice of hotness
Around half a pack of vegan soya mince (dried or frozen)
Two tins of beans – kidney, white, butter or pinto beans all work well
Tomato puree","Serves 4 to 6 peopleLike any good dish, start by frying chopped onion and garlic in a large frying pan. Chuck in some salt, pepper and a hefty sprinkling of paprika; at least a tablespoon.
Add chopped chili pepper – your preference of chili. One whole chili should do the job; go for birds eye if you want a hot one, or one of the larger chili’s, which usually don’t pack quite as much heat. Also, including seeds make it hotter, so ditch them if you are a mega chili weed!
Add the mince once the onions, garlic and chili are soft
When the mince has browned add your beans. I can’t imagine a chilli without kidney beans, they are a must.
Next, add a tin of tomatoes. Also add some tomato puree – how much depends on how rich you want it. Leave it to simmer. The longer you simmer, the tastier it will be. At least half an hour should do the job.
Serve with rice, nachos, tacos or jacket potato. Delicious accompanied with guacamole and salsa!",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_5863-400x397.jpg,0,70

1 can Organic Chickpeas (aprox 240g)
2 cans Organic Chopped Tomatoes (aprox 280g)
2 Large Potatoes, washed
150g Fresh Parsley
2 Ripe Avocadoes
500g Mushrooms
900g raw Spinach
2 cloves Garlic
4 Ripe Tomatoes
1 onion
150g Fresh Basil
Juice of half a Lemon
1/4 cup Olive Oil
1 Tbsp Sunflower Oil
2 springs Fresh Rosemary
1/2 Tbsp Cumin
Salt and Pepper
Loaf of fresh Sourdough Bread","1) Turn your oven on to a low heat
2) Begin by chopping your Potatoes into large chunks, ready for boiling
3) Place a large saucepan of water on to boil
4) Dice your onion and garlic. Leave half the garlic for your mushrooms and the other half for the beans.
5) Slice Mushrooms in half.
1) When water is boiling – place your Potatoes in. Leave for approximately 15 minutes or until soft.
2) Meanwhile, heat your Sunflower Oil in a large Wok or frying pan. Add onion and half the garlic. Saute until brown.
3) Add the canned tomatoes, kidney beans, chickpeas, cumin and about 1/2 cup diced basil. Leave to simmer on a low heat. This should gradually thicken, so by the time you are ready to serve – you have a thick spicy bean mixture! Add salt and pepper to taste. Ideally this should have about 40 minutes to an hour to simmer and let the flavors marinate.
4) When your potatoes are cooked – drain out all the water and mash roughly with a masher or fork. Leave them nice and chunky and the skin on! Add your parsley, olive oil, lemon juice, rosemary, salt and pepper and continue to stir and combine all together.
5) Make small potato cakes with your hands and set aside.
6) Add a little bit of oil into a frying pan and fry off your potato cakes for a few minutes on both sides.
7) Once all are browned on both sides – pop them into the oven to stay warm until serving time.
8) In the same frying pan – add your sunflower oil, chopped garlic and mushrooms. Saute these over a medium heat until your mushrooms are cooked and nice and garlic-y. Add the spinach, rosemary and a sprinkling of salt and pepper closer to serving time.
9) About ten minutes before serving: halve your whole tomatoes and place them under the grill for a few minutes with a sprinkling of salt and pepper and a little drizzle of olive oil.
10) Flan your avocado by halving, removing the stone, scooping out each half with a spoon to separate from the skin and then slicing into a nice flan. Set aside.
11) Slice your Sourdough nice and thickly – you can optionally toast this and add some vegan butter or olive oil!
ASSEMBLE!!
Begin with your slice of sourdough and around it – arrange the potato cakes, spicy beans, mushrooms and spinach mixture, tomato and avocado. Finish your dish with a lovely spring of fresh rosemary.
Enjoy!

107,Fresh and zesty pasta sauce,"450g/1lb pasta – spaghetti or linguini work well, but feel free to experiment with other types, eg fusilli, penne, wholemeal noodles 
2-3 tbsp olive oil (extra virgin if possible)
3 large cloves garlic
2 large, ripe avocados – the ready-to-eat variety are best
2 large ripe tasty tomatoes – eg ‘beefsteak’ variety
½ medium red chilli
15 fresh basil leaves, torn – a good handful
Zest and juice of a lime
Salt and lots of black pepper","Serves 4
OptionsFor those who prefer large quantities of garlic to be cooked, sauté the garlic in some of the olive oil first. Then just mix it in with the chopped vegetables, herbs and pasta as below.
Replace avocados with strips of roasted red pepper – home-made or in a jar. You will need at least half a large jar. Roasted peppers are sold either in brine or in oil. If the former, drain well and do not add extra salt to the dish. If they are in oil, omit most of the oil in the recipe.Greener Pasta!
Boil a kettle of hot water, pour it into your saucepan, add the pasta and a little salt. Bring to the boil, then switch off the heat and cover the pan with a well-fitting lid. The pasta will continue to cook in the hot water – in the usual cooking time but without using extra fuel. Stir occasionally to prevent clumping.Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions – or see our Top Tip above.
While the pasta is cooking prepare the rest of the dish.
If you are cooking the garlic, do so now. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a small frying pan and fry it gently for a minute or two, making sure it does not burn. Remove from heat – keeping any remaining oil – and set aside.
If using the garlic raw, crush and set aside.
Peel the avocados. Remove the stones and chop into chunks.
Chop the tomatoes into chunks.
De-seed the chilli and chop fine.
Drain the pasta and mix in the prepared vegetables.
Add the remaining olive oil, lime zest/juice and basil leaves. Season well.

125,Minty Vietnamese Summer Rolls,"Ingredients to make roughly 20 rolls:
20 rice paper sheets (you can find these in larger supermarkets or Asian stores)
1 avocado, chopped into thin slices
1 small bunch of mint, leaves separated from stalk
1 small carrot grated
1 small onion chopped finely
1/2 cucumber chopped into thin strips
100g of green leaves (I normally use spinach) hard stalks removed
Dipping Sauce:
Soy Sauce
Sesame seeds
A few drops of sesame seed oil
Optional finely chopped chilli or chilli flakes","Arrange all the ingredients so that they are easy to access. The rice paper rolls are very delicate, and get sticky when drying. I have found that the quicker you make the rolls, and the less you handle them you lower the chances of them breaking up. Having said that, do not worry if the paper rips. Just try and minimize the damage, they become much more solid after 15minutes or so. And they taste so good no one will notice the small tears trust me!
Place one sheet of rice paper into a bowl of warm water. Leave for approximately 30seconds or until the sheet becomes malleable.
Take the rice paper out of the bowl and place on a clean plate. Add a small amount of each ingredient, making sure no hard bits are sticking out that could damage the paper.
Now it is time to roll. Fold in 2 opposing sides of the rice paper as tightly as possible. Then take the third side and fold over, making sure it is tight and roll it over the fourth side to completely seal the summer roll.
For the dipping sauce mix the ingredients in a small bowl.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSCF1201-e1412084970596-400x300.jpg,18,752
126,Tofu Sushi Rolls,"Sushi rice – 150g
Tofu – 300g
Peanut butter – 2 tbsp
Soy sauce – 2 tbsp
Mirin – 1.5 tbsp
Sesame oil – 1 tsp
Garlic clove – 1
Avocado – ½
Carrot – 1
Sesame seeds – 10g
Rice wine vinegar – 1.5 tbsp
White sugar – ½ tsp
Salt – ½ tsp
Nori sheets – 1 pack
","1. Rinse and drain the sushi rice in a sieve. Place the rice in a small saucepan with 220ml of water, bring up to a boil, lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes until all the water has been absorbed.
2. Drain and wrap the tofu in kitchen paper then place between two plates with something heavy on top like a couple of tins. Leave to press for 20 minutes. This process allows the tofu to take on more flavour.
3. Preheat the oven to 190 degrees celsius.
4. Prepare the peanut sauce. Mix the peanut butter with 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of mirin, 1 tsp of sesame oil and 1 tbsp of water. Peel and finely chop or grate the garlic, then add to the sauce. Your sauce should be the consistency of single cream. If necessary add a splash more of water to loosen.
5. Prepare the filling. Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and scoop the flesh away from the skin, keeping the shape intact. Cut the avocado into strips lengthways. Peel and grate the carrot. Divide both into 4 equal portions. Cut the tofu into 8 slices and coat with 1 tsp of soy sauce. Place the coated tofu on a tray and bake in the oven for 8 minutes.
6. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a high heat for 1 minute or until golden, then tip onto a small plate.
7. Cool the rice. When the rice is cooked, take it off the heat and mix in 1.5 tbsp of rice wine vinegar, ½ a tsp of salt, ½ a tsp of sugar and most of the toasted sesame seeds, saving a sprinkle for garnishing. Spread the rice onto a plate and leave to cool, then divide into 4 equal portions.
8. After 8 minutes, take the tofu out of the oven and coat with half of the peanut sauce. Bake for another 10 minutes then remove from the oven and slice each strip in half lengthways.
9. Start rolling! Place a small bowl of water nearby. Lay 2 layers of clingfilm larger than the nori sheet over your clean chopping board. Place the nori on top of the clingfilm in portrait orientation. Using your hands, take one portion of rice and spread it evenly onto the half of the nori sheet closest to you, leaving a 1cm gap at the edge of the sheet. Wet your fingertips to stop the rice sticking to your hands.
10. Place your strips of tofu with a portion of avocado and carrots horizontally in the centre of the rice. Drizzle a little of the peanut sauce over the filling, then start rolling the sushi by placing your thumbs underneath the clingfilm and lifting the edge that is closest to you up and over the filling in the centre. Curve the rest of your fingers over the clingfilm and gently press against the length of the roll, squeezing the rice and filling together inside. Continue to roll the sushi away from you until you’ve rolled past the furthest edge of the nori sheet. You may need to use a little water to seal the edge. Repeat until you get 4 sushi rolls.
11. Use a sharp knife to cut each roll in half, then each half into 3 equal pieces. Rinse under the tap between slices to help get a clean cut. Garnish the sushi rolls with a sprinkling of the reserved sesame seeds and serve with the remaining soy sauce for dipping.
Top Tip: if you have a bamboo sushi mat, use it instead of this clingfilm method.

127,Hot & Sour Pad Thai Salad,"30g desiccated coconut
25g pecans, chopped
1 block (around 200g) firm tofu
For the marinade:
60ml water
3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tbsp tamari, good soy sauce or liquid aminos
Zest and juice of 1 lime (unwaxed), a little juice kept back for the raw salad
1 red chilli
½ tsp cayenne pepper
4 dates, pitted
Black pepper
For raw the salad:
1 red pepper
1 medium carrot
15g fresh coriander
4 spring onions
150g beansprouts
Squeeze of lime
10g black sesame seeds
For the cooked salad:
1 tsp solid coconut oil (sesame oil would also work well)
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 red onion
200g tenderstem broccoli","At least an hour before you start cooking, prepare the marinade by combining all the ingredients in a food processor and blending until combined.
Cut the tofu into 1cm pieces, place in a container and cover with the marinade. Leave in the fridge until required.
Thinly slice and de-seed the pepper, slice the carrot into thin batons, chop the coriander (leaves and stems) and slice the spring onions. Put these in a large bowl with the beansprouts, black sesame seeds and the remaining squeeze of lime.
Thinly slice the onion and cut the broccoli lengthways to have even thinner stems.Heat a large frying pan on the hob to a medium temperature. Toast the pecans until they begin to turn brown, add in the desiccated coconut and continue to toast until this turns brown too. Remove immediately and put aside in a bowl.
Add the coconut oil to the pan and mince the garlic into it, then add the onion. Cook for a few minutes until they begin to soften and brown.
Add in the tofu, with the marinade, and give it all a good stir. After a couple of minutes, I like to spoon some of the marinade out into the bowl with the raw ingredients, so that they’re nicely coated in all of the lovely flavours.
Add the broccoli to the pan and cook until wilted, and most of the marinade has been soaked up.
Remove from the heat, stir into the large bowl with the salad, and serve with a sprinkling of the toasted pecans and coconut.NOTES
If you are unable to find tenderstem broccoli, regular broccoli, green beans or pak choi will also work really well.

sliced
1 tsp oil (coconut oil works well)
1 tsp sweet paprika
1 tsp turmeric
1 tbsp red wine vinegar","Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Drain the tofu, wrap it in kitchen paper to soak up any residual water and slice it into small chunks (no smaller than 1cm).
In a baking dish, mix the minced garlic, chopped chilli, turmeric, paprika, soy sauce, red wine vinegar and a squeeze of the lime juice. Cover and set aside. Add the tofu and mix, carefully, until all the pieces are covered with the marinade.
Line a baking tray with a sheet of parchment paper or foil and slice each potato in half. Arrange the potatoes on the tray, skin-side down. Squeeze over some of the lime juice (this helps the dry seasoning to stick) and then sprinkle on 1tsp each of the sumac and oregano.
Line a second tray with parchment paper or foil and slice two of the tomatoes into eight segments each. Slice one of the plums or peaches into eight segments. Arrange these, skin-side down, on the tray.
Place both trays in the oven, the potatoes on a higher shelf, and cook for 20-25 minutes.
While the potatoes are cooking, cut the remaining tomatoes and plum/peach into bite-size pieces, thinly slice the onion and pepper, and chop up the olives and basil. I like to include the basil stalks too, they’re full of flavour. Combine all of these in a salad bowl with a squeeze of lime and some black pepper.
Cut the green beans into 1 inch pieces and steam or boil for about 5 minutes. Rinse under cold water, drain, and add them to the salad bowl.
Remove the potatoes from the oven and turn each one over. Squeeze over the rest of the lime and a further 1tsp each of the sumac, chilli flakes and oregano. Return to the oven for 20 minutes.

139,Peking Jackfruit Pancakes,"1 x 400 g tin young green jackfruit, prepared
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2.5 cm ginger, finely chopped
2 tablespoons rice wine, dry white wine or apple juice
½ teaspoon five spice powder
Pinch of black pepper
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
Thin strips of carrot, cucumber and spring onion (scallion), to serve
½ cup (100 g) hoisin sauce
For the Pancake Dough:
1½ cups (225 g) plain flour, sifted
Pinch of salt
⅔ cup (170 ml) boiling water
1 tablespoon oil, for brushing
","First make the pancake dough. In a large bowl, knead the flour, salt and water until you have a smooth, elastic dough, about 5 minutes, adding a teaspoon more flour if it seems too sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and leave to rest for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C. Place the shredded jackfruit in a loaf tin. Whisk together the sesame oil, ginger, wine, five spice, black pepper and soy sauce and pour over the jackfruit. Roast for 15–20 minutes or until very tender – there may still be liquid in the tin, and that’s okay.
Unwrap the dough, roll it into a log and divide into 12.
Roll each piece of dough into a ball, then flatten slightly by patting it with the palm of your hand. Brush a thin layer of oil over six of the flattened dough balls, then place the unoiled dough balls on top of them to form sandwiches. Use a rolling pin to roll out each sandwich into a flat pancake, flipping it midway so both sides are rolled evenly.
Set a dry non-stick frying pan over medium heat, place a pancake in it and cook until it is puffy and the bottom is flecked with brown, about 2–3 minutes. Flip it over and cook the other side for 2–3 minutes, then remove. Carefully separate the two layers to give you two pancakes. Keep on a plate, covered with a clean tea towel, while you cook the rest, separating them as well, to give you twelve in total.
Transfer the jackfruit to a serving platter. To eat, scoop a little bit of jackfruit onto a pancake, top with a drizzle of hoisin sauce and a few slivers of carrot, cucumber and spring onion, then wrap up and enjoy.Preparing jackfruitAfter draining your tin of young green jackfruit, rinse it well in a sieve under cold running water – this helps to get rid of the slightly sweet jackfruit flavour. After rinsing, cut away the tough core of each piece of jackfruit, then shred the remaining flesh into something resembling pulled pork. Discard all the seeds and seed pods.Credit for the recipe and image: Jackfruit and Blue Ginger by Sasha Gill (Murdoch Books)

141,Spicy Bean Burgers with Avocado Salsa,"1 large red onion 
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves of garlic
2 medium courgettes
2 medium carrots 
1 x 400g tin of kidney beans 
100g cooked rice
1 tbsp harissa paste
2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter, or use sunflower seed butter if making nut free
A small bunch of coriander
50g sesame seeds
For the avocado salsa:
½ yellow pepper
2 tomatoes
1 large ripe avocado
2 tomatoes
½ a small red onion
1 red chilli
Juice of 2 limes
A small bunch of coriander","I like to use the outer leaves of an iceberg lettuce to wrap round the burgers, acting as a crisp bun. That way you can add the salsa and perhaps a little hummus to make a real feast of it. It’s really important that you grate the carrot and courgette by hand as using a food processor can make them very soggy.
Makes 10 burgers   
Place the tomatoes in a bowl and pour over boiling water, leave for 1 minute, drain the water off and gently remove the skin by peeling it off with a small sharp knife. Cut the tomatoes in half and using a teaspoon, scoop out the seeds and discard. Set the remaining tomato flesh aside.
Finely dice the onion, deseed the chilli and chop very finely. Slice the avocado in half, remove the stone and then using a spoon scoop out the flesh in one half and then finely chop. Slice the tomato flesh and yellow pepper into very small juice and then combine all of the ingredients into a bowl. Pour over the lime juice, finely chop the coriander and stir through. Season to taste, cover and leave to stand in the fridge until ready to use.
Finely chop the onion and crush the garlic. Trim the ends from the courgette and carrots and then coarsely grate using a hand held grater. Finely chop the coriander and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large frying pan and add the onion, fry gently for around 5 minutes or until softened and slightly coloured at the edges. Add the garlic, courgettes and carrots to the pan, turn up the heat to medium – high and fry for a further 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the carrots and courgettes have softened and cooked through.
Add the peanut butter and harissa to the pan, season well and continue to cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly, until blended with the vegetables. Take off the heat and leave to stand for five minutes or until cool enough to handle. Meanwhile, drain and rinse the kidney beans and place them in a food processor. Blitz until you have a smooth paste and then transfer to a large mixing bowl. Alternatively, you can place the kidney beans into the mixing bowl and mash by hand, using a fork, until you have a thick paste.
Add the cooked rice, coriander and vegetable mixture to the beans and beat together until combined and pulled into a large ball. Take a handful of the mixture – about 3 tablespoons worth – and shape into a patty approximately 2 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. Scatter the sesame seeds over a flat plate, season and mix together before lightly rolling the burgers in them so that they are evenly coated. Cover the burgers in clingfilm and refrigerate for 1 hour before cooking.
When ready to cook, heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan and cook for about 10 minutes, turning over once or twice, until golden brown and cooked through.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spicy-bean-burgers-400x600.jpg,18,422

Cut the mint leaves vertically into 0.3cm strips.
Parboil the tofu in boiling salt water, then rinse in cold water. Gently “mash” or crumble the tofu into small pieces with your hands. To remove excess water, wrap the mashed tofu into a layer of hemp cloth and wring it, squeezing out the water.
Next, prepare a batter using the flour, red chilli paste and bean paste, adding water until it achieves the desired consistency. The ingredients should be fully combined but still thick, not pourable.
Add the Korean mint leaves and tofu to the batter.

1/4 cup (60g) coconut oil
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
Topping ingredients:
1/4 cup (60g) coconut sugar (for caramel)
3 tbsp (45ml) full-fat coconut milk (for caramel)
3 tbsp (42g) coconut oil (for caramel)
1/4 tsp vanilla extract (for caramel)
Pinch or two of Pink Himalayan Rock Salt (for caramel)
80 – 100g 85-90% dark chocolate or Dark chocolate chips (for topping)
1/4 cup (55g) raw cacao butter melted (for homemade topping)
1/4 cup (30g) raw cacao powder (for homemade topping)
1 tbsp (20g) maple syrup (for homemade topping)","Line a 12 cup muffin tray with baking paper circles. Grease the sides with melted coconut oil. I actually use a 12 cup muffin tray that has loose bottoms!
Preheat oven to 160C (325F).
Process walnuts to a coarse meal.
Mix together all oatmeal cookie ingredients.
Divide mixture amongst prepared muffin tray cavities; approx. 1.5 tbsp.
Press down to evenly distribute in each and then make an indent in the middle of each allowing it to come up the sides a little.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove and gently press down the centres before they cool. Allow to cool in the tray for 15 minutes before removing and place on a wire rack.
Meanwhile mix together coconut sugar, vanilla, salt and coconut milk. Bring to the boil and stir continuously until the sugar has dissolved…about 2-3 minutes.
Add in the coconut oil, bring back the boil and once again stir continuously this time over a medium to high heat for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for one hour.
Place baked cookie cups onto a tray lined with baking paper.
Place 1-1.5 tsp of the caramel into the centre of each baked cup. Place them into the fridge for 30 minutes.
Melt the chocolate or to make your own homemade chocolate, mix the melted cacao butter with the cacao powder and maple syrup. Sweeten to your own taste.
Pour 1 generous tsp of the melted chocolate or homemade chocolate over the top of each cookie cup just covering the caramel. Place in the fridge to firm up for 30 minutes.

144,Seitan Rissoles / Seitanfrikadellen,"In a big bowl mix well:
1 ¼ cup water
1/3 cup neutral oil (I use sunflower)
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce (or Maggi Sauce if you have)
1 teaspoon garlic granules
2 teaspoons mild mustard
1 teaspoon yeast extract (I’d use less Marmite or Vegemite, less than ½ teaspoon)
2 teaspoons hot paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
1-2 finely chopped onions
In a smaller bowl mix:
1 1/3 cups gluten flour
4 tablespoons bread crumbs","Makes about nine rissoles.
Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir well with aspoon. Knead a little with your hand until everything is wellmixed, but don’t knead too long, otherwise you’ll squish theonions out of the dough. Cover the bowl with a warm, moisttowel and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
Heat more neutral oil in a non-stick frying pan to mediumheat. Form 9-10 meatballs and place them in the pan. Theyshould not be crowded, I fry them in two batches.
It’s important not to fry them like you’re fryingmeat: they need to fry slowly on low to medium temperature (Iuse grade 3 of 6) for about 30 minutes. Flip them repeatedlyafter about 8 minutes to let them brown evenly. They stay softfor a long time and don’t start to brown till the end. Afterabout 30 minutes they should be done, you can take them outwhen they have the desired colour.
Like most seitan ‘meats’ they’re best after coolingcompletely. Fresh out of the pan the crust is a little hard,it will soften after cooling while the inside gets firmer.They’re perfect after a night in the fridge. You can reheatthem in a pan or in hot gravy. I serve them the traditionalway, with mashed potatoes, roasted onions in a puddle offrying oil and lots of mustard.

Make up the sausage mix as per the packet and place spoonfuls on the mix in a line, just off centre, on each strip of pastry. Don’t over fill, as you’ll have trouble closing up the pastry.
Fold the pastry over the top of the sausage mix, pressing shut the two edges with a fork. You can prick the pastry in top for some decoration too if you fancy.
Cut into around 8cm individual bites. It doesn’t have to be precise but just make sure they aren’t too small as you’ll end up with sausage bullets!
Cook on a baking tray for around 25 mins, or until golden brown. Make sure you give each one a little room as they don’t cook through and rise properly if they are squashed together.

Optional: 1 x roasted red pepper or 1 large carrot chopped small and fried with the onion and garlic","Serves four or two big portions with leftovers for the next day!
Serving suggestions: wilted kale and toasted sunflower seeds, roasted Brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower and broccoli, steamed broccoliPut the cashews in a bowl with some water and cover with water and leave to soak – allow for two hours unless you have a mega powerful blender!
If using the pepper and roasting your own then rub with a little oil and put on baking tray and into hot oven. Allow for 30 minutes to cook. If using peppers from a jar then you can add later.
If serving with roasted veg, prep and put in oven alongside the pepper. Crunchy veg will take longer than the pepper to roast so timing should be about spot on.
Add pasta to pot of boiling water and cook as per packet instructions. When al dente pour into colander and rinse with cold water. Set aside.
While the pasta is cooking, finely chop your onions and garlic and add to a big pan with oil. Cook until nicely softened but not brown. If using carrot, also chop finely and add alongside the onions and garlic. Cook until carrot is soft.
Scrape down the pan and add the onion and garlic mix to the blender, along with the rest of the ingredients (don’t add the yeast last or you will lose some of it when it whizzes around). If using the pepper, this is when you add it. (Remove as much of the skin as you can before doing so and exclude all pips and the stalk.)
You now need to blend until lovely and smooth. This will take at least three or four goes depending on your blender. Scrape down the sides in between blends to make sure everything is incorporated.
Pour the mixture back into the pot that you cooked the onions and garlic in and allow to thicken on a medium/low heat. Stir frequently.
When thickened you can choose to add the lemon juice. I find that it lifts it a little but taste before doing so. Just add a little squeeze first if you like and then taste again.
Now add the cold pasta into the sauce, mix thoroughly and heat through.
When nice and hot it’s time to serve… Spoon into large bowls with accompanying veg. Dig in!Want more recipes like this? Sign up to Veganuary and we’ll send you meal plans, our celebrity cookbook, recipes and more! Psst… it’s all free!

161,Vegan Toad in the Hole,"2tbsp olive oil
125g strong white flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 pinch of sea salt
275ml soy milk
2 packs Beyond Sausage Brat Original
For the gravy:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 red onion, thinly sliced
250ml vegetable stock
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
1 tsp dark soy sauce
1 tsp yeast extract
1.5 tsp cornflour
Fresh ground black pepper","Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Pour the oil into a metal roasting tin, roughly 20cm / 8in – a cake tin will do as long as it doesn’t have a loose base. Put in the oven and heat for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Add 200ml of the soy milk and whisk until smooth. Add the remaining milk and mix until thoroughly combined.
Carefully take the tin with the hot oil out of the oven; it will be extremely hot. Add the Beyond Sausage Brat Original to the tin, spaced apart from each other, then return to the oven for 2 minutes.
Take the tin carefully out of the oven once more and pour over the batter. Return the tin to the oven and cook for 30 minutes, or until the batter has risen, golden brown and hot throughout.
While the toad-in-the-hole is cooking, make the onion gravy. Heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the onion for 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned, stirring regularly.
Pour the stock into the pan, add the ketchup, soy sauce, and yeast extract. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix the cornflour with a tablespoon of cold water in a small bowl until smooth.
Stir the cornflour into the pan with the onion and return to a simmer. Cook for 1-2 minutes more until the sauce is thickened, stirring. Season with lots of ground black pepper.

163,Sweet Potato Quesadillas,"Olive oil
1 sweet potato, peeled and grated
1 tablespoon maple syrup
Sea salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
1 teaspoon chipotle paste
1 red chilli, finely chopped
1 × 400g tin of white beans, drained
1 avocado
½ a lime
A few sprigs of fresh mint or coriander, leaves picked and chopped
4 corn tortillas
","Most places have started to stock chipotle paste these days, which has made its sweet smokiness easier to come by. If you can’t get your hands on chipotle, ½ a teaspoon of hot smoked paprika will do.Heat a touch of olive oil in a pan, add the sweet potato and the maple syrup and season with salt and pepper.
Add the chipotle paste and the chopped chilli and cook for a few minutes, until the potato has softened and lost its rawness.
Transfer to a bowl and add the beans, then use a potato masher to mash the whole lot up a little – you will still have some flecks of unmashed sweet potato. Season if needed.
Mash the avocado with a little lime juice and stir in the herbs. I use the potato masher again here.
Now heat a frying pan big enough for your tortillas. Lay a tortilla fat in the pan, spoon a quarter of the mixture on to one half of it, then fold over the other half.
Dry fry on one side until it’s blistered and golden brown, then flip over and do the same on the other side. Keep the quesadilla warm while you do this with the rest of the tortillas.
Serve straight from the pan with the mashed avocado.As part of a bigger meal:
Serve with a couple of handfuls of lemon-dressed salad leaves.
Serve with a crunchy salad of radishes, leaves, shaved fennel and coriander, and a quick tomato salsa.

166,Curried Chickpea Burgers,"175g cooked quinoa
1 x 400g tin of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 carrots
1 white onion
1 tbsp curry paste of your choice, just ensure it is gluten and dairy free
3 tbsp gram flour
3 tbsp olive oil","Makes 8 burgersThey freeze well and you don’t need to worry about defrosting them, you can simply fry them gently from frozen until cooked through, making them handy little things.
Begin by peeling the onion and carrots and then finely grating, either by hand or using a food processor. Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan and then gently fry the onion and carrots until softened – approximately 10 minutes.
Place the chickpeas and cooked quinoa into a large mixing bowl and crush together with a fork until you have a coarse, lightly-bound paste. Add the softened onion, carrot and curry paste, season with a little sea salt and black pepper and mash together with a fork until bound together.
Using your hands, form the mixture into 8 burger patties and then coat each burger in gram flour, using as much or as little flour as you need to generously coat the burgers.
Heat the remaining oil in the large frying pan over a medium flame, add the burgers to the pan and fry the burgers on both sides until golden, slightly crisp and heated through.
While the cakes are frying dice the tomatoes, avocado and coriander. Mix together in a small bowl with the lemon juice and season to taste. Serve the burgers with a little pile of tomato salad on top and whatever accompaniments you like – roasted sweet potato wedges and a big green salad go very well.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ChickpeaBurgers2-400x267.jpg,8,405
167,Chinese Red BBQ Strips,"For the seitan strips:
– 125g (1 cup) wheat gluten
– 2tsp chinese five spice powder
– 1tsp smoked paprika
– 2tsp onion powder
– 2tsp garlic powder
– 180ml (3/4 cup) cold vegetable stock
– 3tbsp light soy sauce
– 3tbsp peanut butter
– 1tbsp sesame oil to grease the tin (or regular oil if you have no sesame)
For the sauce:
– 125ml (1/2 cup) hoisin sauce
– 125ml (1/2 cup) soy sauce
– 50g (1/4 cup) soft brown sugar
– 3 cloves of minced garlic
– 2tsp Chinese five spice powder
– tsp onion powder
– small amount of vegan red food colouring","Start with preparing the seitan by heating the oven to 375f / 190c / Gas Mark 5.
You will also need:
– 8 inch x 8 inch greaseproof baking dish.
Preparing the Seitan:
1) Combine the first 5 dry ingredients and set to one side.
2) To the cold vegetable stock, add the soy sauce and peanut butter. Whisk together well.
3) Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, add the liquid and bring together. You may need to use a spoon or spatula to combine initially but once it forms a dough the best thing to do is just get stuck in with your hands.
4) Kneed the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes or so until it toughens up and holds its shape. Let it rest for 10 minutes then kneed again for a further 5-10 minutes.
5) Oil an 8inch x 8inch dish, shape the seitan dough to the dish and bake in the oven for 30 – 40 minutes.
Preparing the Sauce:
1) Whilst the seitan is cooking in the oven, you can move on to preparing the sauce. Very simply add all of the ingredients to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat for 10 – 15 minutes until it has reduced, the sugar has melted and thickened the sauce.
Marinating and Cooking the Seitan:
This recipe works best if you can prepare it the day before and leave time for the seitan to marinate in the sauce overnight. However, if you’re pushed for time then marinating for 4 hours or so should suffice.
1) Once the seitan has cooled, slice into strips and add to a fresh dish large enough to accommodate the marinade.
2) To marinate, take half of the prepared sauce, add 50ml of water to thin it out and cover the seitan strips. Cover with cling film and pop it in the fridge.
3) To cook the strips, once they have marinated for as long as you have time to allow, add them to a heated frying pan along with the marinade and fry on medium-high for 10 minutes.
4) Turn the strips over regularly to ensure even cooking and add the remaining half of the sauce. Lower to heat to medium and continue cooking for a further 5 – 10 minutes to heat through the sauce. Be sure to continue turning the strips every few minutes for even cooking.
The strips are now ready to use as you wish, whether it be with noodles, fried rice or in a veggie stir fry.

170,Cream of Broccoli Soup,"1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or 3 tablespoons vegetable broth or water
1 large onion, chopped
2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
32-ounce carton low-sodium vegetable broth or 4 cups water mixed with 2 to 3 teaspoons salt-free all-purpose seasoning blend
5 to 6 cups coarsely chopped broccoli florets and peeled stems
2 cups frozen green peas, thawed
One 15- to 16-ounce can great northern beans or cannellini, drained and rinsed, or one 12.3-ounce package firm silken tofu
1 cup unsweetened rice milk or other unsweetened nondairy milk, plus more as needed
To finish the soup:
2 cups finely chopped broccoli florets
1/2 cup chopped fresh dill or parsley, or a combination, plus more for garnish
Juice of 1/2 lemon, or 2 tablespoons bottled lemon juice, or to taste
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste","Serves: 6Heat the oil, broth, or water in a soup pot and add the onion. Sauté over medium heat until translucent, then add the garlic if desired. Continue to sauté until the onion is golden.
Add the broth and broccoli. Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer gently until the broccoli is tender but not overcooked, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the beans or tofu and half the green peas.
Continue to cook just until everything is nicely heated through.
The easiest way to puree this soup is to simply insert an immersion blender into the pot and puree until it’s as smooth as you’d like it to be. You can also leave it a bit chunky. If you don’t have an immersion blender, transfer the mixture to a regular blender and puree (don’t overprocess!), then transfer back to the soup pot. Add enough nondairy milk to give the soup a medium-thick consistency.
To finish the soup, add the remaining green peas, the finely chopped broccoli florets, the chopped herbs, and the lemon juice. Stir together, then season with salt and pepper. Cook over very low heat for 5 minutes longer, or until the finely chopped broccoli florets are tender-crisp, then serve.Like this recipe?

175,Refried Beans with Corn Tortillas,"Sesame Oil 
2 cloves crushed garlic
1 onion finely sliced
½ cup coriander/cilantro finely chopped
1 jar organic mixed beans
1 to 2 tbsp tamari or shoyu sauce (to taste)
Mixed salad greens
Salsa or relish","A few easy steps to refried beans:Heat about 4 tbsp of sesame oil in a heavy frying pan or a wok, over medium heat.
Add the garlic and sliced onion and sauté until softened and beginning to brown, about five minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the coriander.
Add the cooked beans, and using a big spoon, or potato masher start mashing the beans in the oil.
The unique taste of refried beans occurs as a result of slowly frying the starches inside the beans in the oil, so you want to add the beans a little bit at a time if you are using more than one jar. This way of cooking the beans makes sure they all get fried and take on the flavours of the vegetables and coriander.
Once all the beans have been mashed add the shoyu or tamari and a little water, until you get the texture that you want. Keep it a bit looser than you eventually want, as they will continue to firm up as they cool off the heat.
These will also freeze well, so it’s a good idea to make more than you need. The recipe above can be easily doubled or more.Plate up:Warm the corn tortillas in a dry frying pan for a few minutes either side.
Remove to a plate.
Spread with some vegan mayonnaise, fill with salad and top with the beans and some relish or salsa if desired.

180,Raw Carrot Cake,"1 cup of dates
1 cup of walnuts
2 cups of grated raw carrot 
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
Dash of nutmeg
Dash of sea salt
3/4 cup raisins
For the frosting:
1 cup of cashews and 6 pitted dates soaked together in water for around and hour
Juice of 1 lemon
Dash of sea salt
Orange zest to decorate","The key to this recipe is not to over blend as you need the mixture to stay firm and try to get as much of the excess moisture out from the carrots as possible.
1) Put the walnuts into a food processor and pulse until they look crumbly, then add the dates and pulse again.
2) Add the grated carrot and spices and pulse until the mixture starts to look dough-like, add raisins and pulse for another thirty seconds – be careful not to over mix here, better less than more.
3) Push the carrot cake mixture down into ramekins – choose the size you like, or make a variety from small bites to large handfuls! Refrigerate for at least one hour.
4) Meanwhile, make the frosting. Drain the cashews and dates and put them in your food processor along with the lemon juice and salt.
5) You’ll probably need to add a little water to get the mixture moving. Blend until smooth and creamy(if your blender is high power) or smooth but textured (if it’s not).
6) Take your carrot cakes from the fridge and pop them out of their ramekins. Pipe over with the icing.

3 cups frozen sliced okra

½ tsp cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1 bay leaf
Sea salt or kosher salt and coarse ground black pepper to taste
4 green onions, chopped, white and green parts
½ cup chopped flat leaf parsley plus chopped leaves for garnish","Gumbo filé, which is dried and ground sassafras leaves, is an ingredient sometimes added to gumbo but is not included in this recipe. It imparts an earthy flavor and is also used to thicken the gumbo. After consulting a chef colleague from New Orleans who specializes in Cajun cuisine, she informed me that the filé is purely an optional ingredient. In restaurants it is often contained in a shaker on the table which gives the diner the option to use it as desired.
Prepare your mise en place (assemble and measure all ingredients).
Heat the oil in a large cooking pot over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and celery and sauté until softened, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté an additional minute. Add the butter or margarine and stir until melted. Sprinkle in the flour, stir to combine and cook until the flour emits a nutty aroma, about 2 minutes.
Incorporate the water in increments while stirring vigorously. Stir in the tamari, Worcestershire, liquid smoke, tomatoes with liquid, okra, chickpeas, thyme, optional kelp powder, cayenne and bay leaf. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat; partially cover and simmer for a minimum of 1 hour. While the gumbo is cooking, prepare white or brown rice, your choice, and keep warm until ready to serve.
Five minutes before serving, stir the green onions and parsley into the gumbo (reserve a little for garnishing). Add salt, black pepper or additional cayenne, kelp powder and/or liquid smoke as desired to taste. To serve, place a scoop of white or brown rice into serving bowls and ladle in the gumbo. Garnish with green onions and parsley.

189,Seasonal Fruit Tart,"For the pastry: 
250g / 9 oz plain flour (wheat, spelt or gluten-free), plus extra for dusting 
25g / 1 oz caster sugar (optional) 
125g / 4½ oz vegan margarine cut into cubes, plus extra for greasing 
Ice-cold water 
For the filling: 
Use one of the following fruits, whichever is in season at the time! 
6 medium stalks organic rhubarb 
450g / 1lb organic cherries 
8-10 organic plums, depending on size 
6 medium organic apples (e.g. a mix of Bramley and Cox) 
1 tablespoon fairtrade brown sugar or agave nectar 
1 teaspoon vegan margarine 
Squeeze of lemon juice (optional) 
Pinch of cinnamon (optional) 
For the glaze: 
Apricot preserve, warmed and sieved","To make the most of fruits in season check the helpful guides from Eat Seasonably and What’s in Season. Celebrate fruits at their very best, full of flavour and nutrients and produced in harmony with the environment.To achieve the best results when making pastry, everything needs to be as cool as possible, including your kitchen. You can even pre-chill your flour and the bowl you’ll be using!
Sieve the flour and sugar into the bowl and add the cubes of vegan margarine. Rub the fat into the flour using your fingertips, working quickly and with a light touch to avoid the fat melting, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Check for any remaining lumps of margarine by shaking the bowl to bring them to the surface.
Make a well in the centre of the mixture and add the chilled water, a little at a time. Lightly work the mixture to form a ball, adding a sprinkle of flour if the mixture is too wet, or a touch more water if it’s too dry.
Allow the pastry to ‘rest’ in the fridge for 20-30 minutes prior to using it.
Roll out the pastry on a floured surface, then line a 9” greased flan tin and return to the fridge for a further 30 minutes to chill, as this should help prevent the pastry from shrinking.
Pre-heat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/Gas Mark 5.
Bake the pastry case ‘blind’ (partially baking pastry before adding a wet filling, to avoid making it soggy). Prick over with a fork, line with greaseproof paper and fill with ceramic baking beans, dried pulses or uncooked rice.
Bake for about 15 minutes or until the pastry starts to become a light golden brown. Remove the paper and beans, then return to the oven for a couple of minutes. Remove the pastry case from the oven and allow to cool.
In the meantime make the fruit filling. Wash and prepare the fruit by either trimming the rhubarb, stoning the cherries or plums or coring the apples. Reserve the most attractive fruits for decorating the top.
Cut the remainder into small pieces and simmer in a pan over a gentle heat with the margarine, sugar or syrup, a splash of water and the optional lemon juice and cinnamon until soft and pulpy. In the unlikely event that the mixture is far too wet, simply remove any excess juice and thicken the fruit pulp with a little cornflour or tapioca flour. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then use to cover the base of the pastry case.
Cut the reserved fruit accordingly – the rhubarb into pieces, the cherries and plums into halves and the apples into slices – and arrange neatly on top. If necessary, brush the apple slices with a little lemon juice to prevent them from browning. They look great laid in concentric circles, each slice overlapping the last! If you like, you can also brush the fruit with a little melted vegan margarine and sprinkle with cinnamon.
Bake for 25 minutes at 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4. If you want to brown the edges of the fruit, just flash the tart under a hot grill.
For a really quick and easy glaze, brush the tart over with the warmed, sieved apricot preserve.
Serve the tart warm or at room temperature. For an extra finishing touch, lightly dust with icing sugar and serve with plain soya yogurt which has been strained and flavoured with a little vanilla and cardamom.
Alternatively, you could indulge in some delicious Booja Booja ‘icecream’ which is based on cashew nuts and agave nectar. The ‘Keep Smiling Vanilla M’Gorilla’ would make a great accompaniment, or maybe the ‘Pompompous Maple Pecan’ or ‘Coconut Hullabaloo’!",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MM-Apple-Tart-400x267.jpg,4,268

192,Beer Battered Tofu Fish and Chips,"180g plain (all-purpose) flour
1 tsp cornflour (cornstarch), plus extra to dust
1½ tsp onion powder
½ tsp garlic powder
1 tsp chilli powder
325ml pale ale (make sure you get a vegan one)
350g/1 block fresh firm tofu, drained and cut into 8–10 slices
1 sheet nori, cut into pieces to match the tofu slices
Salt and pepper
1 lemon, cut into wedges to serve
For the chips:
4–5 King Edward potatoes, peeled and cut into chunky chip shapes and left to dry out on a tea towel
750ml vegetable oil
For the mushy peas:
200g fresh or frozen peas
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
A handful of fresh mint, finely chopped
For the Tartare Sauce:
½ jar vegan mayonnaise
2 tbsp capers, rinsed
1 gherkin, chopped
½ shallot, chopped
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
A twist of lemon
","To make the chips, heat the oil to about 160˚C/320˚F. When a cube of bread browns in about 40 seconds, put half the chips in – you’re going to cook them in two batches – and fry for about 10 minutes until the insides are soft. Keep the temperature constant. Remove with a slotted spoon and leave to drain on a baking sheet covered with paper towels.
While the chips are draining, make the beer batter by combining the flour, cornflour, onion, garlic and chilli powders with the ale, mixing thoroughly. In a pan, heat the oil to 170˚C/340˚F. Check the temperature by putting a couple of drops of batter in the oil and seeing if it crisps up.
Dust the tofu and nori slices with a little cornflour, then coat with the batter mixture and add to the hot oil in batches. They should take about 3–4 minutes to get really crisp. Flip them over midway so that they get nice and golden on both sides. Remove with a slotted spoon, place on some kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil and season to taste.
When you’re ready to eat, heat the oil to 190˚C/375˚F, put the chips back in and cook until they’re golden and crispy. This should take about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, put the peas in boiling water with a little salt, bring to the boil, then cook for a couple of minutes until they’re slightly overdone. Strain, put them back in the pan, then crush with a potato masher, adding a little water if necessary to make them soft. Add the apple cider vinegar and chopped mint. Season with salt and pepper and slowly heat while mixing for a couple of minutes.
Put everything together on a (big!) plate with a generous wedge of lemon and a dollop of Tartare Sauce*and enjoy.* Tartare Sauce:Simply mix all the ingredients together and chill until ready to serve. The saucecan be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.

193,BBQ Tofu Wings and Ranch,"For the tofu:
1 block (250-300g) firm tofu
2 tbsp gram flour + 3 tbsp water
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried onion granules
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp cayenne pepper
For the BBQ sauce:
1 tin tomatoes (400g), puréed
2 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp good soy sauce
Juice of ½ an orange
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried chilli flakes (or cayenne pepper)
Black pepper
For the ranch:
2 tbsp tahini
4 tbsp water
Handful of fresh dill leaves (about 10g)
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tsp lemon juice
½ tsp dijon mustard
½ tsp vinegar (apple cider, red wine)
1 tsp dried marjoram or oregano
Pinch cayenne pepper","THE DAY BEFORE: cut the block of tofu into 5 slices, each about 1 cm thick, then cut each slice in half again so you have 10 pieces. Place between sheets of kitchen paper on a plate and freeze. Remove from the freezer a couple of hours before you want to start cooking, in order to defrost.Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Once the tofu has defrosted, press between sheets of kitchen paper until most of the water has gone (you can do this using a heavy book). You don’t want the tofu to be so dry that it crumbles, but just to remove most of the water.
Combine the ingredients for the tofu coating ‘batter’ in a bowl.
Dip each tofu wing into the batter to fully coat and place on a non-stick baking tray, greased with a little oil if needed.
Place on the top shelf of the oven and cook for 30 minutes, turning once half way through.
Next, put the BBQ sauce on to simmer. Combine all the ingredients and cook on a medium heat on the hob, covering with a lid once it starts to bubble and spit. You want a thick sauce, so simmer for 20-30 minutes.
While the wings and BBQ sauce are cooking, make the ranch. Put all the ingredients into a food processor and blitz until smooth.
Once the wings have been cooking for 30 minutes, remove from the oven. Carefully place each one in the BBQ sauce, coat using a spoon, then place back onto the baking tray.
Cook for a further 10 minutes, arrange on a plate with the ranch and serve!NOTES:Freezing the tofu isn’t essential, but it leads to a chewier texture. If you’re not freezing it, drain and press for a little longer, ensuring as much water is squeezed out as possible.

Remove and put aside for later.Next, make the cashew ricotta: put all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor with 3 tablespoons of cold water and blend until completely smooth – this should take 2–5 minutes, depending on how powerful your machine is. It should be the consistency of normal ricotta. Scoop out into a bowl and wash the processor bowl.Now make the dough. Put the four and water into the processor with a good pinch of salt and a tablespoon of olive oil and pulse until the dough comes together in a ball. Tip it out and bring it together in your hands.Get your frying pan on a medium to high heat. If you have two pans about the right size you can do both the pizzas at once, otherwise you can do one after the other, as they cook quickly.Cut the dough into two equal halves and cover one half for later.Put the other half on to a floured work surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 1cm thick circle about the size of your frying pan.Drizzle a little oil into the hot pan, then carefully lift in the dough. Leave it on the heat for about 3 minutes, so the base is starting to cook, while you quickly top the pizza.Spoon half the tomato passata over, then the mushrooms. Dot with the cashew cheese and the olives.Pop the pizza under the grill for 4–5 minutes, until it is cooked through and the cashew cheese is browned.Repeat with the second pizza.To finish, strew with some rocket leaves and cut into generous slices.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Mushroom_Pizza_41-400x600.jpg,12,14

6) Whilst the sauce is cooling, melt your chocolate and brush the insides of the moulds with the melted chocolate. Put them in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to cool and firm.
7) Once your sauce is cooled and thickened ready for use, fill the moulds but be sure to leave a small gap at the top for you to encase the caramel with chocolate.
8) After filling the moulds with caramel, finish by covering with the remaining melted chocolate and be sure to fill in any gaps.

Season with a little salt ( plus a pinch of smoked paprika if you have traditional quinoa) and boil for between 12 and 15 minutes until it has swelled and you can see a little “halo” around each grain.
2. Meanwhile you can drain the peas using the same sieve ( reserve the liquid if using chickpeas – this aquafaba is great for vegan mayo or baking).
3. Grate about 1/2 of the orange zest into the quinoa pan and then peel the orange and cut into slices or segments – the choice is yours. Reserve any juice.
4. Now prep’ your veg: Remove the outer leaves of the sprouts and slice fairly finely.
5. Slice the spring onions, using as much of the green as possible.
6. Crush the garlic and pick the parsley leaves from the stalks.
7. Once the quinoa is cooked, and has absorbed all the water, add the Carlin peas ( or chickpeas) and the vinegar, set aside with a lid on so that it steams.
8. Now take a frying pan, heat up 1/2 of the olive oil and add the sliced sprouts, 1/2 of the garlic and spring onion. Fry briefly, just until you can really smell the garlic.
9. Mix together the tahini with the remaining olive oiled garlic, the orange juice and season.
10. Now serve up the quinoa and peas, stirring in about 1/2 of your sprouts and then topping with the rest of them, the orange, the parsley, the pumpkin seeds and chilli flakes. Taste and balance the seasoning.
Serve hot or at room temperature. Perfect for a lunch box too.

226,Almond Milk,"2 cups of almonds (either blanched or skinned is fine)
9 cups cold water
","EquipmentBowl and water for soaking the almonds
Measuring cups
Food processor
Jam straining bag
Glass bottle with airtight lidAdd the almonds to a bowl and fully cover with cold water. Soak overnight or for at least 8 hours; you may need to top the water up the next day if you’re not using them immediately, as they soak it up and expand.
* Time Saving Tip *
In a hurry? Pour boiling water over the almonds, soak for two hours and they will soften quick enough to use.
Drain and rinse until the water runs clear. The nuts will have expanded and you’ll now have almost 3 cups worth, so measure out 1 cup and add to the food processor.
Blitz for 20 seconds until they’re broken into tiny crumb-like pieces, then pour in 3 cups of chilled water and blitz again for another 30 seconds. Stretch the jam-straining bag over the edges of the bowl, and pour the mixture in.
After two minutes, gently squeeze the outside of the bag to get as much milk out of the pulp as possible. Set the pulp aside and repeat the steps twice more.
* Time Saving Tip *
If you’re making this regularly, using a jam bag stand makes the process easier, this is mine.
Once you’ve finished, rinse your straining bag and leave to dry naturally. Look after it this way and it can be reused over and over again.
* Top Tip *
You can use the leftover pulp as almond ‘flour’ for other recipes like our ginger nut crunch muesli. Simply spread out on a baking tray and ‘dry out’ for 1 hour in a 125c oven. Once cool, store in an airtight jar.
Pour the milk into glass containers that have airtight lids, I use Kilner bottles. Store in the fridge for up to 5 days; as the milk doesn’t contain emulsifiers, it will naturally separate in the bottle. Simply shake well each time before using and enjoy the goodness of your own homemade almond milk – it’sperfect for breakfast, fresh fruit smoothies, ice lollies, or as an everyday delicious milk substitute!

150ml / 5.1 fl oz canned coconut milk
2 tablespoons caster sugar
½ teaspoon salt
2 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
Few drops mirin (optional)
For the topping:
Strips of fruit approx. 6cm long, cut as thinly as possible (e.g. watermelon and mango or peach)
Sieved apricot jam","Rinse the rice well using a sieve until the water runs clear. Drain thoroughly in a colander and allow to dry for 20 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with the cold water and bring to a boil over a high heat. Cover and cook over a moderate heat for 10 minutes.
Reduce to a low heat and cook for a further 10 minutes. The rice should be tender and the water absorbed.
Remove from the heat but keep covered and stand for 15 minutes.
(Alternatively, if you have a rice cooker, that can be used to cook the rice.)
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the coconut milk, sugar, salt, cardamom pods and optional mirin. Warm over a low heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.
Remove the cardamom pods and allow the coconut mixture to cool a little.
Add to the rice and gently stir through. Keep stirring until all the liquid is incorporated. Cover the rice with a clean damp tea towel.
Take spoonfuls of rice, one at a time, and shape into rectangles with rounded ends. Press firmly but gently without squashing the rice.
Brush the top of each piece of nigiri with jam and top with a fruit slice, applying just enough pressure to secure it in place.
Do not refrigerate the nigiri before serving. Consume the same day. Serve with small dipping bowls of raspberry coulis, if desired.Did you like this recipe? Explore more vegan seafood ideas.

You can eat this cheese straight away with tortilla chips, pour over nachos (maybe chuck it in the oven for a bit to make sure the cheese is really warm) or use as your cheese topping on pizza…Spread as liberally as you like! Sometimes you feel like more or less cheese, depending on your mood and/or the pizza toppings. The photos above are both with the same cheese… Just lots more on one that the other.
When cooked to your liking, remove and eat!*According to everything I’ve read, this cheese can last up to 7 days in the fridge.

2 tsp Vanilla Extract tsp
2 Canned coconut milk (Chilled)
80 g Icing Sugar – for garnish
15 g Pistachios – for garnish
5 g Rose petals – for garnish
","1. For the swiss roll. Preheat your oven to 160ºC Fan/Gas 3. Line a shallow baking tray approximately 30cm x 20cm with greaseproof paper.
2. Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then add the cornflour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt and sugar and stir together.
3. Pour the milk, vinegar, oil and vanilla extract into a jug and whisk until combined.
4. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir well with a light hand, be careful not to overwork the batter then pour into the prepared baking tray and bake in the oven for approximately 25 minutes until cooked through and a skewer comes out clean.
5. Meanwhile for the buttercream. Add the icing sugar and butter into a food processor and blitz together. Add the soya milk, a little at a time until the buttercream starts to combine and is smooth. You want a medium to firm texture.
6. Once the cake is cooked. Leave to cool for around 5 minutes and then carefully roll into a swiss roll shape, keeping the greaseproof paper on. When cooled after around half an hour, gently unroll the log and spread with black cherry jam and the buttercream. Once again carefully re-roll the cake this time gently removing the greaseproof paper as you roll. Once rolled place the log on a piece of clingfilm and roll tightly and place in the fridge to chill until needed, you could actually freeze the cake at this stage for half an hour.
7. To assemble. Slice the swiss roll into 8-10 slices and place inside a medium size glass bowl. Drain the cherries , reserving the juice, and add to the bowl then drizzle over some of the reserved juice.
8. For the custard. Add the soya milk and vanilla extract into a pan and gently warm. Remove from the heat and add 1-2 tablespoons of the warmed milk into a jug with the Birds custard powder and sugar. Stir until you have a smooth paste and then add the rest of the milk, whisk and then pour back into the pan. Heat gently until thickened and then remove from the heat. Leave to cool for 10 minutes then pour over the sponge mixture, place in the fridge and leave to set.
9. For the topping. Remove the lids off the canned coconut and scoop the solid coconut cream into a bowl (you do not want any of the coconut water) then add the icing sugar and whisk until smooth. Pile the cream topping onto the trifle, spread evenly to the outer edges..
10. Garnish with pistachios and rose petals
NOTES
1. You could use ready made custard but this will have a looser set.
2. An alternative garnish would be with leftover cherries and chocolate shavings.

3 tbl soy sauce

3/4 cup of vegetable stock
2 tsb garlic powder","Preheat the oven to 220 degrees and line a baking tray.
Press the tofu – put it on a flat surface with kitchen towel on top and underneath and then stack heavy books on top. The aim is to squeeze some of the moisture out, not squash it flat. Press it for at least 15 mins, longer if possible, this helps it crisp up when cooking.
Cut the pressed tofu into cubes – up to you how big but I would recommend about 2 x 2 cm cubes.
In a large bowl mix together the soy sauce, mustard, olive oil, vegetable stock and garlic powder.
Add the tofu and ensure it’s well coated, marinate for at least one hour (the longer the better) and stir occasionally.
Place the marinated tofu in a single-layer on the baking sheet and place the tofu in the oven. After 15 minutes turn over and add some extra marinade. Cook for another 15 minutes.
Take out of the oven once nicely browned.
You can either eat it straightaway in a salad, stir-fry or pasta dish, or keep refrigerated and use within the next 5 days.

350g frozen pitted cherries, or 200g fresh
50g flaked almonds","Heat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.
After rinsing, place the quinoa in a saucepan with 100ml water. Cover, bring to the boil and simmer until the water has evaporated (about 10 minutes). Leave covered for another 5 minutes.
While the quinoa is cooking, simmer the cherries in a saucepan on a medium heat. Mash with the back of a wooden spoon or fork to transform them into a jam-like consistency. This will take around 10 minutes.
Once the quinoa is ready, add it to a mixing bowl with the tahini, oil, maple syrup, salt, pumpkin seeds and half of the flaked almonds. Give it all a good stir and pour it into your baking tin, pressing down with the back of a spoon.
Next, pour on the cherries and smooth out the surface. Sprinkle on the remaining flaked almonds, pressing down to give an even coverage.
Place on the top shelf of the oven and cook for 30 minutes.
NOTES:I find frozen cherries work really well in this recipe, as they cook down more easily. However, if you use fresh cherries, add a tbsp or two of water to the pan when simmering to help the cooking process.

Then grate the potatoes.Peel and grate the apple and pear and them mix them with the grated potatoes.You need to get as much moisture out of the mix as you can- squeeze it, pat it with a towel. Add salt and your seasonings.Separate the mix into 4 equal parts and make circles with them; think burger shaped. Really try and press the mix together to help it bind.Add enough oil to a frying pan to cover the bottom and fry the rostis for roughly 8-10 minutes each side. But use your judgement here, you want them starting to crisp on the outside.NOTE: Now in theory the rostis should be done now. However if they are not binding well (and they don’t always) then put them in a preheated oven for 5 minutes to finish them off.

Cut into 12 slices and enjoy!NotesFor the dish size, I used one that’s 18cm x 23cm but sizes can vary slightly. You may have to adjust cooking times if the overall size is much different as smaller dishes will make a thicker flapjack that may need cooking longer.
If you want to, you can remove the flapjack from the oven about 15 minutes into the cooking time, and carefully turn it out onto a flat baking sheet, so as to cook it more evenly on the underside. This isn’t essential though, and if you do decide to, be very careful as it will still be quite crumbly.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Chocolate-and-Date-Flapjack-400x267.jpg,16,7

1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
Cracked black pepper
Other ingredients:
Breadcrumbs (e.g. gluten-free ones)
On the side:
Potato salad
Ketchup","Start squeezing all the water out of 400g of firm tofu.This takes about 20 minutes. The more you squeeze the water out of tofu the more it will absorb flavours.
Then roughly crumble the tofu into a food processor and all other ingredients. Blend well until you get a smooth mixture. You may need to add a TINY bit of water as well. And don’t taste the mixture, the uncooked chickpea flour tastes bitter and needs to be cooked first before it is consumed.
Then spoon out the mixture with a tablespoon. And press into a bowl with breadcrumbs. Bread evenly on all sides and then fry in hot oil until golden brown (make sure the oil is hot). Place on a kitchen towel as it will absorb some of the excess oil.
Serve on its own with ketchup or other dips or with a deliciousAustrian potato salad.Enjoy!

150g / 5½ oz vegan margarine, cut into cubes

269,Chilli Cornbread,"2 cups cornmeal
1 cup plain flour
2 tsps baking powder
5g dried chipotle mora chilli
1 pinch pink Himalayan salt
1/3 cup organic coconut oil
2 tblsps maple syrup
2 cups almond milk
2 tsps raw apple cider vinegar or freshly squeezed lemon juice","Makes 9-12 servings
EquipmentTwo mixing bowls
Measuring cups
Measuring spoons
Small pan
Whisk
Wooden spoon
Baking paper
8″ x 8″ baking trayTurn the oven on to 175c and line your baking dish with baking or greaseproof paper. Melt the coconut oil and leave to cool.
Pour the almond milk and apple cider vinegar or lemon juice into a bowl and whisk together. This will create a ‘buttermilk’, so don’t worry when it starts to curdle or separate.
Finely chop the chilli into tiny pieces and add it with all of the other dry ingredients into another bowl. Stir thoroughly.
* Top Tip *
Wearing disposable gloves helps to avoid any accidental chilli ‘after burn’ if you forget and touch your skin after chopping.
Add the cooled, liquid coconut oil and maple syrup to the ‘buttermilk’ bowl, and whisk briskly for a minute or so to combine and create a slightly frothy mixture.
Pour the liquid into the dry ingredients bowl and stir together until you have a thick batter without any lumps. Pour into the baking dish and pop in the oven for 30-35 mins. To check it’s cooked, insert a skewer into the middle and it should come out clean.
* Serving Suggestion *
The chilli cornbread tastes delicious both warm and cold, and is a great side for soup, chilli con carne, or dipped in flavoured oils and vinegars. The cornbread will keep for 1-2 days in an airtight container, however it always tastes best on the day you make it as gets drier over time; surely a great reason to share it with your friends!

2. Bring the vegetable stock to a simmer in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Add the bulgur wheat and gently cook for 8–10 minutes until the grains have plumped up and are cooked through. Remove from the heat and stir through the red onion mixture and parsley. Set aside.
3. Meanwhile, make the chermoula. Heat a small, dry frying pan over a medium heat, add the cumin and coriander seeds and cook for 2 minutes until just toasted. Transfer to a small mixing bowl, add the remaining chermoula ingredients and mix to combine. Season to taste, then set aside.
4. Preheat the oven to its hottest setting and, once it is roasting hot, turn it to the grill setting. Pierce each aubergine twice with a small, sharp knife. Place on a baking sheet under the grill, with the oven door closed, for 25 minutes or until the aubergine skin is black and the flesh is collapsed and soft, using tongs to turn halfway through this time. Remove from the oven, then slice each hot aubergine lengthways down the centre, being careful not to cut all the way through, and split open. Drizzle with the olive oil and lemon juice, and season with the sea salt and some pepper.

288,"Rosemary Oatcakes (savoury, wheat-free, vegan cracker)","1 tablespoon of finely chopped rosemary
300g (10½ oz) plain oatmeal (ground oats)
½ teaspoon sea salt (or to taste)
175ml – 200ml (6 – 7 floz) approx filtered or spring water
50g (1¾oz) spelt flour or fine oatmeal to roll with
A dash of oil for oven tray","Finely chop a good handful or more of fresh rosemary leaves, until you have at least a tablespoon of finely chopped rosemary.
Turn oven on to approximately gas mark 7 (220˚C/425˚F).
Mix all dry ingredients together.
Add 175ml (6 floz) of the water and mix thoroughly with the dry ingredients. Add the remaining 25ml of water a little at a time, until you have a dough-like ‘rollable’ ball (the best way to mix is to use the back of a spoon, with a pressing type motion or just get your hands in there). When you have added all water necessary, press firmly together with your hands. You may be tempted to add more water to get it to bind, but make sure that you really need it first, otherwise you’ll end up with a soggy mix! If you put too much water in it’s not really a problem though, just add extra oatmeal or spelt flour.
Split the dough into two (makes rolling easier) and roll out on a flour dusted surface until it is about 3 mm (8th of an inch) thick (I like to use spelt flour or fine oatmeal to roll/dust with, but whatever you have will do).
Cut with cookie cutter and place onto an oiled oven tray. If you don’t have a cookie cutter, then just cut into squares or triangles with a sharp knife.
Place on oven tray and then bake in preheated oven between 20 and 25 minutes, until they begin to gently tan.
Lift from tray and let them cool down on a cooling tray. They should firm up nicely with an enjoyable crunch. Some people like them less crunchy, in which case take out before they start to tan. I am in the ‘crunchy’ camp personally. Explore.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Oatcakes1-400x270.jpg,17,17
289,Crispy Salt and Pepper Spiced Tofu,"400g of firm tub tofu (I used Cauldron Original)
1 tsp of Chinese 5-spice (feel free to substitute with your preferred spice)
1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (rice bran is good as it has a high smoke point, olive oil works well too)
1 tablespoon of plain flour (if you’re gluten or wheat intolerant, you can substitute for your preferred flour or use gram/chickpea flour)
1 teaspoon of dried chilli flakes (optional) 
Splash of soy sauce
1 sliced chilli, 1 spring onion, few slices of red onion (optional – for garnish)
2 tablespoons of oil (rice brand oil is good as it has a high smoke point but olive oil works well too) 
Salt & pepper
Your favourite vegan dipping sauce – I love sweet chilli with this dish","I know tofu can be a little daunting to cook with if you haven’t used it before, particularly if you’re a new vegan and attempt to treat it like you might have done a non-vegan protein source.
Top tofu tip!Before we get started it’s probably worth sharing my number 1 favourite tip for tofu – freeze it first, then defrost it.
Whilst this means a little more planning, it seems to make a big difference in the firmness, how easy it is to work with, and also the texture of the end result. It’s not the end of the world if you haven’t time to freeze it before using but for future reference, I find it works best to keep tofu in the freezer and just take it out to defrost the evening before or the morning of the day I’m going to be using itUnpackage the tofu and drain well, squeezing the excess moisture over the sink before placing in a clean tea cloth
Wrap the cloth around the tofu and press down on it to remove as much of the moisture as possible – I find placing it between two chopping boards is a good method
Cut the tofu into cubes – I find slicing it in half into two flat slabs is a good way to start
Place the tofu in a bowl, add the salt, pepper, spices, and soy sauce and mix gently until all pieces are evenly coated
Add the flour and mix again, until evenly coated
Heat the oil in a pan, then carefully add the tofu (you don’t want to burn yourself with splashes of hot oil!)
Fry the tofu, turning occasionally, until golden
Serve as is with the garnish or dipping sauce or add at the last minute to your favourite stir fry dish
Enjoy!",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Frying-tofu-400x267.jpg,11,37

292,Gooey Chocolate Brownies,"1 x 400g tin of aduki beans, drained and rinsed

200g light soft brown sugar
55g cocoa powder
55g ground almonds
1 tsp gluten-free baking powder
100g dark dairy-free chocolate
1 tsp vanilla extract","Makes 9 brownies
You will need a 23 cm square tin for this recipePreheat the oven to 180c and lightly grease and line a 23cm square brownie tin.
Begin by combining the ground flaxseed in a bowl with 9 tablespoons of water, stir together and set aside to thicken up – the flaxseed will absorb all of the liquid, acting as a binder for the brownies.
Place the aduki beans into a food processor and blitz until you have a smooth paste. Add the flaxseed mixture, oil, sugar, cocoa, ground almonds, baking powder and vanilla extract and pulse until you have a rich and glossy batter.
Roughly chop the dark chocolate into small chunks, add it to the mixture and pulse briefly just to combine the chocolate into the mixture. Spoon the brownie batter into the tin and then bake in the oven for 55-60 minutes, stopping half way through to cover the brownies loosely in foil to stop them catching.
Remove from the oven and set aside to cool down until just warm, this way the brownies will have had time to set a little but still be deliciously warm.Like this recipe and want to try more? Sign up with Veganuary today for recipes delivered straight to your inbox.

1oz/28g caster sugar
300g cherries, pitted
2 tbsp caster sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract","Preheat the oven to 350f.
Get a 7 inch pie dish ready.Start by making the pastry. In a large mixing bowl add the flour and fat. Using your hands rub the fat through the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse sand.Stir in the sugar. Make a well in the middle of the flour then add the aquafaba, using a wooden spoon to mix it all together.Lightly flour your kitchen surface, then plop the dough out of the bowl. Knead lightly for around 5 minutes until the pastry is smooth. Roll into a ball and place in a ziplock bag. Chill the pastry in the fridge for at least 1 hour.Whilst the pastry is chilling, start on the cherry filling. Pit the cherries – I find the easiest way is to use an empty wine bottle and a chopstick. Place 1 cherry in the opening of the wine bottle and use the sharp end of the chopstick to push out the pit.Once all the cherries are pitted add them to a saucepan with the 2 tablespoons of sugar and vanilla extract. Cook on a medium-low heat until the juices run out and the fruit is soft. Set aside to cool.Divide the pastry into two equal parts.Flour your surface and roll out one piece of pastry into an 8 inch circle and carefully lay it over the pie dish.Using your fingers press the pastry into the dish. Cut away the excess pastry. Scoop out the cherries using a slotted spoon, making sure not too take too much of the juice, into the pie casing.Roll out your second piece of dough and carefully lay it over the top of the pie. Using your thumb press all the way around the edge of the dish to seal the pastry. Cut away the excess pastry. Then using your finger, press the thumb sealed part inwards to make a little flute.If you want to, you can use your excess pastry to make a little decoration! Cut two slits in the top of the pie crust then brush it with a little aquafaba.Bake the pie in the oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown, rotating half way.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/19823242262_86d7338065_b-1-400x419.jpg,4,189

308,Sweet Chilli Relish,"8g dried ancho poblano chillies with seeds
2 roasted red peppers from a jar (or you can roast your own)
5 cherry tomatoes
1 large clove garlic
1/2 red onion
chopped into 3 chunks
1 cm piece fresh
peeled ginger
Pinch of pink Himalayan salt (or table salt)
Generous pinch of black pepper
1 tsp sugar (optional)
1 tblsp white wine vinegar
1 tblsp balsamic vinegar","Makes 1 large jar
EquipmentMeasuring cups & spoons
Food processor
Frying pan
Wooden spoon
Airtight glass jar
SieveSoak the dried chilli and seeds in hot water for 10 mins to soften. When they’re ready, drain into a sieve and tip into the processor.
Add the rest of the ingredients to the food processor and blitz together for 15-20 seconds until everything is chopped into tiny pieces (it doesn’t need to be completely smooth).
Pour the mix into a frying pan and simmer gently on a medium heat for 8-10 mins, so that most of the liquid is absorbed and the flavours intensify. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.
* Top Tip *
Keep an eye on the pan as the timings are just a guide – don’t over simmer the relish or it will dry up and burn.
The relish is ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it’s still moist – taste and adjust any seasonings or sweetness to your own taste. Leave to cool and store in an airtight jar.
* Serving Suggestion *
This sweet chilli relish is delicious on crackers, open sandwiches and serves as a great party dip for slices of toasted pitta bread. It’s also perfect for mixing through cooked pasta and veggies to add a spicy twist, plus any other tasty combinations you discover! Store it in the fridge and it will keep for up to 1 week (if you haven’t eaten it all by then!)

309,"Beetroot, Butterbean and Mint Dip","2 beetroot, leaves trimmed
2-3 garlic cloves
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tin butter beans
2 tsp tahini (optional)
Half a lemon, juiced
A handful of fresh mint leaves
1 tbsp walnut oil or olive oil","Serves 4Heat the oven to 180C. Wash the beetroots, brush with a little oil and wrap each one in foil. Wrap the garlic cloves into a loose foil parcel and place beets and garlic into the centre of the oven for 45 minutes.
Dry fry the cumin seeds in a non-stick frying pan for a minute or two keeping them moving so they don’t burn. Using a pestle and mortar or spice grinder grind the toasted seeds and set aside.
Reserving the liquid, drain and mash the butterbeans and add in tahini, if using. I mash the beans quite coarsely so as to keep a chunky texture but if you prefer a smoother consistency you might want to use a blender. Once mashed stir in the cumin, lemon juice and season well.
Peel the beetroot and garlic. Cut the beetroot into quarters and place in a blender. Cut the very tips of the garlic cloves and squeeze the soft garlic pulp in with the beetroot. Add a tablespoon of the reserved liquid from the beans and pulse. If the beetroot needs a bit of encouragement to move then add more of the reserved liquid as necessary. Blend until you have a smooth purée. Season to taste.
Coarsely chop the mint leaves and grind in a pestle and mortar with the oil. If you don’t want to use oil then finely chop the leaves and scatter on at the end.
To serve, dollop the bean mixture into a bowl or plate and create a shallow well in the centre. Spoon the beetroot purée into the well and drizzle the mint and oil over the top.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/figsandfennel-beetroot-butterbean-mint-dip1-400x267.jpg,2,155
310,Coconut Panna Cotta,"For the panna cotta:400ml or 15 oz regular (i.e. NOT light) canned coconut milk
400 ml or 15 oz coconut cream
100g or 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/4 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of agar agar powder
4 tablespoons cold water
1 fresh vanilla podFor the raspberry compote:1 punnet fresh raspberries (c. 250g or 2 cups), washed
Juice of half a small lemon
1 tablespoon water
1/2 tablespoon sugar","Makes: 5 teacup-sized panna cottas
Preparation time: 10-15 minutes
Cooling and setting time: 4 hours +First, make the panna cottas. You need to do this way in advance of serving them, at least four hours prior. The panna cottas will keep well overnight, so you can always prepare them the night before you need them, if necessary.Add 4 tablespoons of cold water to a small bowl. Stir into this 2 teaspoons of agar agar, and set aside for 5 minutes to ‘bloom’.
Add to a saucepan the coconut milk, coconut cream, sugar, and vanilla bean. Bring this mixture to a boil, then whisk in the agar-water mixture. Let the whole thing boil for another minute or so, then sieve into a large mixing bowl.
From the mixing bowl, carefully pour the hot coconut mixture into your serving glasses or dishes. Let the mixture cool for about half an hour before transferring the glasses to your fridge.
Refrigerate the panna cottas for at least 4 hours, until set.Once the panna cottas are cooling you can get to work on the compote.
Add the fresh raspberries, lemon juice, water and sugar to a medium saucepan. Crush up the raspberries a little in the pan with a spoon. Bring this mixture to a boil and allow it to keep boiling for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally.
Then, turn the heat right down. Leave the pan uncovered, on a very low simmer, until most of the water has evaporated and the fruit has cooked down into a nice, smooth compote-y paste. Keep stirring the mixture every 10 minutes or so to help break the raspberries down.
If you’re not a fan of raspberry seeds, sieve your compote before cooling it. Otherwise, simply set it aside for 40-50 minutes, or until your panna cottas are set.
When the compote is cool and your ‘cottas set, scoop on top of each one an even amount of raspberry compote. Serve, preferably as soon as possible, and at most within 2-3 hours of assembling.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cid_9D29157C-9964-4AB0-BD86-F73D1347F4DD-400x327.jpg,4,27

Olive oil (1/2 tablespoons)

Salt and pepper to taste","Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image:split-pin.co.ukRemove the skin from your garlic cloves and put into a food processor. Give it a blitz so the garlic is chopped up
Drain and wash your chickpeas and add to processor. Give it another whizz around
Cut your lemon in half and squeeze out all the juice of one half
Add the tahini, olive oil and a splash of water and blitz again (a bit longer this time to give everything a chance to mix)
Scrape down the sides of the processor and give it another blitz
Time for the consistency and flavour check! If the hummus looks too dry, you can add a little more water, oil or lemon juice (or a combination of all three). This is why the tasting part is important, as the lemon can overpower if too much is added. Blitz again
Add salt and pepper to taste and keep processing/adding (water, oil, lemon juice or salt and pepper) until you’re happy with the desired consistency and taste

Sprinkle with the chilli flakes or paprika and cook for 25 minutes. Slice the root ends from the garlic cloves (without unpeeling them) and add these to the tomato tray and cook for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool while you prepare the sauce.
2. Zoodle the noodles! This takes about 10 minutes, and I usually do this while the tomatoes are roasting.
3. To make the sauce, blend together the avocado, basil (stalks included), lemon juice and nutritional yeast.
4. Unpeel the garlic cloves, slice them, and combine in a bowl with the zoodles, tomatoes, olives and sauce.
This dish is great served with lemon-chilli sauteed broccoli and roasted chickpeas, which add a lovely crunchy topping.

3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp finely ground pepper
3 tbsp white sugar
Flavourless vegetable oil for frying
6 slices of your favourite bread (seeded bread is good as the seeds get beautifully caramelised)
Maple syrup to serve
*If you don’t have Vegg use 3/4 tsp nutritional yeast and 1/4 black salt whisked into 30mls water","Switch your oven on and put the tray inside. This is to keep cooked slices warm while cooking more.
Whisk the brine/aquafaba until it reaches ribbon stage (around 4-5 mins in a stand mixer on med-high speed).
Add the yolk mix (if it is very stiff, add a little more water – it should be the consistency of washing up liquid) and salt and pepper. Continue whisking for another minute.
Add the sugar 1 tbsp at a time, making sure it is well combined each time.
Transfer to the flat bottomed dish. Cut your bread in half diagonally. Place 4 pieces in the aquafaba mix. Turn to coat both sides. It won’t sink into the bread very much but that’s OK.
Heat your pan to med-hot, pour in a tbsp of veg oil and pop your slices in. Do not try to move them until the aquafaba mix looks melted on the top side.
Using a spatula, you may need to work a little to separate the slice from the pan. Flip and do the same again. Each side should be golden brown.
Put slices in oven to keep warm. Serve with maple syrup.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13015590_10156840898045436_7675113852784700822_n-1-400x727.jpg,12,487

332,Three Layered Aubergine Tower,"1 Aubergine
Olive oil

333,Gooey Pecan Pie,"For the pastry:
250g / 9 oz plain flour (wheat, spelt or gluten-free), plus extra for dusting
125g / 4½ oz vegan margarine, cut into cubes, plus extra for greasing
Ice-cold water
For the filling:
450g / 1lb golden syrup
50g / 2 oz fairtrade soft brown sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
125g / 4½ oz granary breadcrumbs
175g / 6 oz toasted pecan nuts, roughly chopped
To decorate:
Whole pecan nuts","To make the pastry, sieve the flour into a large bowl and rub in the cubes of vegan margarine with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Work quickly and with a light touch to avoid the fat melting. Check for any remaining lumps of margarine by shaking the bowl to bring them to the surface.
Make a well in the centre of the mixture and add some chilled water, a little at a time. Lightly work the mixture to form a ball, adding a sprinkle of flour if the mixture is too wet, or a touch more water if it’s too dry. Cover and chill for 20-30 minutes.
Grease a 9” fluted flan tin, preferably with a removable base. Roll the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured surface and line the tin. For an extra finishing touch, you can crimp the edge with your thumb. Prick over the pastry case with a fork, to prevent the base puffing up during baking. Cover and return to the fridge while you prepare the filling.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/Gas Mark 6 and put in a heavy baking tray to heat through. Baking the pie on a hot baking sheet will ensure a crisp base to the pastry case.
To make the filling, gently warm the syrup over a low heat, making sure it doesn’t boil. Stir in the brown sugar and vanilla extract.
Remove from the heat and add the breadcrumbs and chopped pecans. Add a few more breadcrumbs if the mixture seems a bit runny.
Pour the mixture into the pastry case and level the surface. Decorate the top with the whole pecan nuts, placing them in concentric circles.
Bake the pie on the preheated baking tray for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, then reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4. If the pecans appear to be getting too dark brown, cover the pie with foil.
Continue baking for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden and the filling is lightly firm and set. The top should be chewy and the middle soft and moist, with the pecans nice and crunchy.
Remove from the oven and leave in the tin to cool a little and firm up. Serve your pie warm or cold. You could add a dash of maple syrup to your favourite vegan cream or ice cream alternative to accompany this wonderfully gooey treat.Like this recipe?

334,"Peanut Butter, Tahini and Chocolate Chip Cookies","1 tsp psyllium husks, or 1 T flax seeds
4 Tbsp water
200g plain white flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
½ t baking powder
½ tsp fine sea salt
100g vegan butter, at room temperature
100g caster sugar
100g light brown sugar
2 Tbsp soy milk
130g smooth peanut butter (try to use 100% peanut varieties if you can)
50g light tahini
160g vegan dark chocolate
2 Tbsp white sesame seeds
Pinch flaky sea salt","In a small bowl whisk together the ground psyllium husks/ground flax seeds with the water. Set aside to thicken into your egg mixture.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the vegan butter, sugars, soy milk and psyllium/flax egg mixture until smooth and fluffy. Add the peanut butter and tahini and beat for another few minutes.
Add the flour mixture and beat gently until just combined. Finally add the chocolate chips, reserving a small handful for decorating the top of the cookies later.
Cover the dough with cling film and place in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 170c and line two baking trays with baking parchment.
Using a cookie dough scoop or a tablespoon, place scoops of dough around the size of walnuts on the prepared baking trays with a few inches between each cookie. You should fit 10 per tray.
Top each cookie with a couple of the reserved chocolate chips. Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with the sesame seeds and the flaky sea salt.
Gently press down each ball of dough with a fork. Don’t worry about making a pattern or design on top – this will disappear as they bake.
Bake for 20 minutes, being careful not to let the cookies burn on the edges. Remove from the oven and leave to cool fully on a wire cooling rack.
Once cooled, serve and enjoy!Did you enjoy these cookies? Explore more of our vegan sweet treats!

335,Low Carb Carbonara,"SAUCE INGREDIENTS
150g raw cashews (soaked for 4 hr or overnight)
160ml cold water
200g soft tofu, diced
2 tbsp of nutritional yeast 
3 tbsp of good quality wholegrain mustard
Optional: 1 1/2 tbsp protein powder (soya bean or pea protein powder work well).
Pinch of nutmeg
Salt and pepper
OTHER INGREDIENTS
1 tbsp coconut oil
3 plump garlic cloves, crushed
3 rashers of diced vegan bacon
700g courgette, ideally spiralised
250g edamame/soya beans
250g button mushrooms, sliced
To garnish: freshly chopped herbs (I have used parsley in the photos pictures, but torn basil leaves are also a lovely alternative) and a sprinkle of ground flaxseed if desired.","Soak the raw cashews for 4 hours or overnight (the cashews will plump up!), drain away the water and place the soaked cashews in a blender or food processor.Add the remaining sauce ingredients and blend for a few seconds to form a creamy sauce.Spiralise your courgettes. If you do not have a spiraliser, vegetable peeler peelings can be used.In a big non-stick pan, melt the coconut oil. Add crushed garlic and vegan bacon. Sauté for about 3 mins before adding in the spiralised courgettes, mushrooms and edamame beans. Continue cooking for about 6-8 mins to cook through and to evaporate as much moisture as possible (this prevents the final sauce from becoming too watery).Add the carbonara sauce to the vegetables and cook though for 4-5 mins. Serve, garnishing with fresh herbs and ground flaxseed to boost the nutritive profile.SO MAN

Spring onion, sliced
Carrots, sliced
Mushrooms, especially the exotic kinds!

","The night before, make the broth by wiping the kombu with a clean cloth, then steeping in cold water overnight. Remove the seaweed, retaining the broth. (If short of time, steep the kombu in the water for 30 mins, then heat to near-boiling but DO NOT let it boil!)
Combine all the dipping sauce ingredients and refrigerate.
When you are ready to eat, place the broth in a pan on the portable stove and bring it to a gentle boil. Start adding ingredients from the platter. Vegetables like carrots and cabbage take a little longer to cook, so put some of those in first, then the tofu, and pick them back out when they are done! Keep adding ingredients from your platter.

383,Whole Roasted Coconut Cauliflower,"For the Coconut Paste:
4 spring onions, roughly chopped
1 green chilli, deseeded and roughly chopped
1 small bunch of coriander, stalks and leaves separated, leaves reserved for scattering over the cauliflower, stalks roughly chopped
4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
1 small thumb of fresh root ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
2 teaspoons ground turmeric or 1 small thumb of fresh turmeric, peeled and roughly chopped
1 tablespoon cumin seeds, toasted
1 tablespoon coriander seeds, toasted
400ml can coconut milk
For the Coconut Cauliflower:
500g baby potatoes, larger ones halved
1 large cauliflower (about 750g)
4 kaffir lime leaves
4 tablespoons coconut oil
juice of 1 lime
1 teaspoon coriander seeds, bashed with a pestle and mortar or rolling pin
100g curly kale, washed
2 red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped, plus 1 extra, cut into slivers, for garnish (but this is optional!)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
","1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/Gas Mark 6.
2. First, make the coconut paste. Using a food processor or stick blender, blitz the spring onions, green chilli, coriander stalks, garlic, ginger, turmeric and cumin and coriander seeds with half the can of coconut milk until a rough paste forms.
3. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, lower in the potatoes and boil or 15 minutes or until a sharp knife passes through them easily. Drain and set aside.
4. Place the cauliflower in a deep roasting tin and pour the remaining coconut milk around it. Scatter the kaffir lime leaves over the coconut milk. Rub 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil over the cauliflower and season well with salt and pepper. Then use a spatula or spoon to rub the spice paste all over the cauliflower, getting into every crevice of each floret. Squeeze the lime juice over the cauliflower. Cover the tin tightly with foil, place on the middle shelf of the oven and roast the cauliflower for 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons coconut oil in a separate shallow roasting tin on the top shelf of the oven above the cauliflower for a couple of minutes. Carefully remove the tin from the oven, arrange the potatoes in a single even layer in the hot oil and use a potato masher to press down on them just to split their skins. Scatter the mustard and coriander seeds over the top, season well with salt and pepper and roast on the top shelf for 45 minutes until the potatoes are crispy and golden all over.
6. Once the cauliflower has roasted for 20 minutes, lift the foil away and baste the top with the bubbling, spiced coconut milk from the tin. Roast, uncovered, for a further 25–30 minutes until the top of the cauliflower is crispy and charring.
7. When the roasted potatoes are done, remove the tin from the oven, scatter the kale and chopped red chillies over the potatoes and stir to coat in the flavoured oil. Roast for 5 minutes until the kale is just starting to wilt but is still bright green.
8. Lift the kale and potatoes out of the tin with a slotted spoon and arrange on a large platter. Place the cauliflower in the centre of the platter and spoon over any bright yellow liquid from the tin. Scatter over the reserved coriander leaves. At the table, use a serrated knife to slice the cauliflower into bold wedges and, if you want extra heat, garnish with the slivers of bright red chilli.

384,Roasted Celeriac and Caraway Soup with Herb and Caper Croutons,"For the soup:
1 medium celeriac (approx. 900g before peeling)
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tsp caraway seeds
Bouquet garni of bay, rosemary and sage 
600ml vegetable stock, preferably homemade
100ml soya milk (or other dairy free milk)
For the croutons:
100g stale bread cut into very small cubes
2 cloves garlic, chopped finely
Zest of a lemon
A large handful of parsley-or a selection of herbs that you like
1 tbsp capers
4 tbsps extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper","Serves 4-6 |Dietary: Vegan, Wheat Free (without the croutons)
Soup:Pre heat the oven to 200c/ gas mark 6.
Peel the celeriac using a sharp peeler and remove any areas where the roots are still visible.
Chop into 1 cm cubes and place in a roasting tin with a splash of rapeseed or vegetable oil.
Roast the celeriac for 25 minutes or until it is softened and golden around the edges. Add the caraway seeds and return to the oven for another five minutes.
While the celeriac is roasting heat a little oil in a large sauce pan and gently cook the onion, until it is really soft and starting to caramelise. Add the garlic and fry for another 5 minutes.
Add the roasted celeriac, bouquet garniand caraway to the onion mixture and stir well.
Pour on the stock and soya milk and simmer for 5 minutes.
Remove the bouquet garni and blend until smooth with a hand blender. Taste, season and serveTip: A bouquet garni is a small bunch of herbs that you add to soups and stews to infuse the dish with flavour-it is removed before serving. Traditionally the herbs are “hard herbs” such as bay, rosemary, sage, thyme, all of which grow well in the British winter. You can tie them together with clean string (you can buy cooking string from kitchen shops) or use a heatproof plastic freezer clip-one that has been washed in a hot dishwasher or placed in boiling water before use to sterilise.
Croutons:Preheat the oven to 200c/ gas mark 6
Heat a roasting dish in the oven. Add the oil and then the bread and mix well.
Cook in the oven for approximately 10 minutes and then add the chopped garlic and stir in. Return to the oven and roast for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally so that the bread is crispy and golden.
Finely chop the herbs and capers together with the lemon zest.
Add the chopped herbs to the crispy croutons and mix together. Taste and add pepper (you probably won’t need salt as the capers are salty already)
Use to garnish the soup-any leftovers can be stored in an airtight box in the fridge and will keep for about 3 days.Tips: These croutons are a great way of using up stale bread-they are traditionally made with sourdough or ciabatta style bread. You can also use a wheat free or spelt bread. Croutons on their own (without added herbs) will keep for weeks in a sealed container out of the fridge-once you add fresh herbs they won’t last so long and need to be kept cold. If you like things spicy add some flaked chilli to the croutons. Croutons don’t need to be just for soup-they are also great added to pasta dishes, rice or salads. Vary the herbs that you use – parsley is ideal but basil, chives, dill, sorrel and coriander would also work.

389,Peach Pastries Danish,"For the Custard Filling
250ml plant milk (oat is best)
1/2 tsp vanilla bean paste
50g icing sugar
30g corn starch
pinch turmeric powder
20g vegan butter
For the Peach Halves
3 peaches (or six canned peach halves)
For the Pastries
375g pack pre-rolled puff pastry (make sure it’s plant-based)
4 Tbsp plant milk
1 tsp vegetable oil
½ tsp agave syrup (or maple syrup)
For Finishing
80g icing sugar
3 tsp plant milk
5 Tbsp unsalted pistachios, roughly chopped","To Make the CustardIn a small saucepan, combine 200ml of the plant milk, vanilla bean paste, and icing sugar. Whisk well to combine and place over a low heat.
Place the remaining 50ml of plant milk in a small bowl and add the cornstarch and turmeric powder. Whisk well until smooth and no lumps remain.
Gradually whisk the cornstarch mixture into the warmed plant milk. Keep whisking constantly over low heat until the mixture thickens dramatically. Once thickened, leave the mixture to bubble a couple of times before removing from the heat and vigorously whisking in the vegan butter.
Pour the custard into a baking tray (this will allow it to cool more quickly) and cover with cling film, making sure the film is making contact with the surface of the custard.
Once cooled to room temperature, refrigerate the custard for a minimum of 20 minutes.To Peel the PeachesIf using fresh peaches rather than canned, fill a large bowl with ice cold water.
Place a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat and carefully drop the peaches into the water. Leave them there for maximum three mins or until the skins start to split.
Use a slotted spoon to remove the peaches from the hot water and put them straight into the cold water to stop them from cooking.
The skin should slip off easily, but if not, you may need to use a vegetable peeler to start the process.
Once peeled, halve the peaches and remove the stones. Set aside.To Make the PastriesPreheat the oven to 200c fan.
Remove the pastry from the fridge and carefully unroll onto a baking tray lined with parchment (if the end of the pastry is a little still and doesn’t want to unroll, leave it to warm up for 2 minutes).
Remove the custard from the fridge and transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on high speed until smooth again. If you don’t have a stand mixer, beat with a whisk until smooth.
Divide the dough into 6 squares using a pizza cutter (for me each square was 12.5cm).
In a cup, mix together the plant milk, oil, and syrup. This will be your “egg wash”.
Using a pastry brush, apply a small amount of egg wash to the centre of each square.
Fold the corners of the square into the centre and push them down gently to stick.
Add a heaped tablespoon of custard to the centre of each pastry square. Follow with a peach half and push down gently to make sure the custard squeezes out further than the peach half.
Brush the pastry with the egg wash and place in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.To FinishWhisk together the icing sugar and plant milk until smooth and thick enough to drizzle off the whisk.
Drizzle the icing over the pastries.
Sprinkle the pistachios over the pastries before serving.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/peach-danish-recipe-400x266.jpg,6,681

396,Oreo Chocolate Cheesecake,"2 cans of full-fat coconut milk (chilled overnight)
1 tub of Tofutti plain vegan cream cheese
7oz (200g
1 cup) vegan dark chocolate
5oz (150g
1.5 cup) Oreos
3tbsp vegan margarine
4tbsp powdered sugar","1) Start by crushing 150g of Oreo biscuits. The easiest way to do this is by blitzing in a food processor but if you don’t have one feel free to pop them into a sandwich bag, cover with a cloth and smash them with a rolling pin.
2) Melt the 3tbsp of vegan margarine and add this to the crushed biscuits.
3) Press the biscuit mixture into your pan until the bottom is evenly coated and then pop this into the fridge.
4) Take the can of chilled coconut milk from the fridge, carefully open it and scoop out the hard coconut fat from the top. Be careful not to get any of the watery section as this will make it more difficult for the cheesecake to set. Add to this the tub of vegan cream cheese and powdered sugar. Blitz it all together until smooth (1-2mins).
5) Melt 150g of the chocolate, add this to the coconut/cream cheese mixture and combine.
6) After that you have a smooth, chocolate mixture, take your Oreo biscuit base out of the fridge. Dollop the coconut/cream cheese mixture on top and smooth it off.
7) Here is where a little patience is required; leave the cheesecake to chill for 2 hours although it works best if you leave it overnight (I know I couldn’t the first time so I totally wouldn’t blame you if you had 2 hours ready to count down on your stopwatch)!
8) Once chilled, take the remaining 50g of chocolate, chop it finely and use it to top the cheesecake to add texture and even more chocolatey goodness to your cheesecake.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Oreo-Cheesecake-400x531.jpg,4,764

1 tablespoon vegetable extra virgin olive oil
1 jar Belazu Verbena Harissa Paste
Washed leaves from the carrots
Edible herbs or flowers like basil, nasturtium, tarragon, or borage
","Trim the leafy tops from the carrots and then make the crust. Mix the salt and flour together in a bowl, add the rosemary and oil and stir in the water. Knead by hand or in a standing mixer for a couple of minutes to obtain smooth dough. Let it rest for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 160C
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1cm. Cut rectangles large enough to wrap the dough individually around each vegetable and press the edges together to seal.
Put the dough-wrapped carrots on an oven tray lined with baking paper and bake for 45 minutes until the dough is hard and the veg inside are tender (test with a skewer).
Once the carrots are cooked, slice open the salt crust and leave until cool enough to handle. Discard the crust and use a cloth to rub the skin from the carrots.
For the bases, take one cooked carrot and slice it lengthways into 4 strips about 1/2cm thick, saving any offcuts. Lay each strip slightly off centre of 4 serving plates.

200g (7oz) mushrooms
Splash of olive oil
200g (7oz) puy lentils (or brown lentils)
450ml (15fl oz) spring water
1 heaped teaspoon allspice
1 heaped teaspoon cinnamon
Pinch ground cardamom
500ml (17fl oz) passata (or tinned tomatoes)
1 heaped teaspoon coconut sugar
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 large handful fresh parsley
150g (5oz) rice pasta
1 small apple
For the Cashew ‘cheeze’ sauce:
100g (3½ oz) cashews
1 large lemon
Pinch black pepper
½ teaspoon sea salt
1 heaped teaspoon dried parsley
Extra water (to thin if needed)
","You will need:
An oven proof dish approx 21 x 15cm (6cm deep) or 8½ x 6 inches (2½in deep).The cashew sauce is made by first soaking the cashews for up to an hour to make them soft enough to blend.Place the cashews into a mug or jug along with the juiced lemon, salt, pepper and parsley.
Allow the cashews to soak in the lemon juice for up to an hour and then blend with a blender to create a thick creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick then add a dash of water to achieve your desired sauce-like consistency.
Roughly chop red onion and mushrooms.
Crush or finely chop garlic and saute in a medium sized pan with onion and mushrooms (with a splash of olive oil) for a couple of minutes to bring out their flavour.
Add the lentils and water to the pan and bring to the boil.
In the meantime add allspice, cinnamon, cardamon, sea salt, coconut sugar and passata to the pan, stirring to mix everything together.
Once the pan has come to the boil turn down to a low/medium heat, placing the lid on. Stir regularly over a period of about 45 minutes or until all water has absorbed and the mixture resembles a thick sauce. If you are busy and want to come back to this later, then simply cook for about 30 minutes, turn off and leave it to finish cooking with the lid on, in its own heat.
Whilst the lentil part is cooking in the pan, cook the pasta, drain it and put to the side.
Slice apple into thin slices and roughly chop parsley. When the lentil part has cooked, add the parsley to the pan and mix in.
Spoon about half of this lentil mixture into an oven proof dish and add a layer of your cooked rice pasta (this should be about ½ of your pasta). Make up another layer on top of the pasta with your apple slices.
Spoon the rest of your lentil mixture on top of your apple layer and then add another layer with the rest of the pasta.
Spoon/pour on your cashew sauce on top of the final layer of pasta. If the cashew sauce seems too thick, then add a little water to loosen it up.
Your layers might resemble something like this:
(base) lentil – pasta – apple – lentil – pasta – cashew sauce (topping)
But remember there is no right or wrong. If your creativity is inspired, then let it flow!
Place your whole dish in the oven at gas mark 6 (200˚C/400˚F) for approximately 40 minutes and then serve hot with veggies or salad.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lasagne-400x267.jpg,8,786

2 tsp baking powder

Makes 1 loaf and Serves 8
Preheat the oven to 200c and lightly grease a baking tray.
Peel the sweet potato and cut into 2cm chunks. Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil, add in the sweet potato and boil gently for 10 minutes or until the sweet potato is very tender to a knife point – you want them almost on the point of collapse as this will help when pureeing them. Remove from the heat and drain, place in a food processor and blitz until completely smooth.
Place the flour, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk together until combined. Add the sweet potato puree, water and olive oil and mix together until combined and pulling into a ball of dough. Use your hands to pull the dough together and knead very lightly for a minute or two just to smooth out the dough and help bring it together.
Shape the dough into a circle around 6 inches in diameter, smoothing the edges and the top with your hands. Place on the baking sheet and then use a sharp knife to cut two crosses into the top of the loaf, about ½ cm deep, so that the loaf is already marked into 8 wedges before it goes into the oven.

4 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp mirin 
2 tsp toasted sesame oil

3 wood ear mushrooms (or any mushroom of your choice), finely sliced
350g/12oz fresh firm tofu
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
400g/12oz pack dumpling skins ","To make the sauce, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
For the dumpling filling, heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil in a pan, then add the onion, garlic, ginger and chilli and sauté for about 4 minutes until cooked through. Add the carrot, spring onions and mushrooms, then crumble the tofu into the pan. Cook the mixture for 10–15 minutes until it’s quite dry, then season with the soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Leave until cool enough to handle.
Take a dumpling skin in one hand, then dip the index finger of your other hand in a little water and use it to wet the top half of the skin. Put about ½ tbsp of the filling mixture into the middle of the skin, then fold the skin over to form a half-moon shape, crimping and sticking the edges together as you go. Repeat with the remaining skins and filling.
In a large frying pan with a lid, heat the remaining vegetable oil over a high heat. Add the dumplings to the pan and fry, uncovered, for about 4 minutes until the bottoms are golden and crisp.
Add a ladleful of water and quickly put the lid on the frying pan to steam the dumplings for 2 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to fry, uncovered, until any leftover water has evaporated – be careful as the hot liquid can splash. Keep an eye on the bottom of the dumplings at this stage as you don’t want them to burn.

415,Black Bean Sliders with Homemade Bitty Buns,"For sliders:
1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup cooked brown rice
1 cup frozen corn kernels
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, finely diced
1 tablespoon grapeseed or olive oil
3 tablespoons mild or medium salsa
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/3 cup brown rice flour
For bitty buns:
1 1/2 cups water, warmed to between 110-120 degrees F
2 teaspoons agave nectar
4 teaspoons active dry yeast
3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vital wheat gluten","Homemade veggie burgers can be a challenge to some! Vegetable patties can be cooked by baking, frying, or grilling. For this recipe, I formed the patties the night before and then froze them in order to make them grillable. This actually worked really well. Note, however, that I grilled them in a grill pan, not on an outdoor grill. Your results may vary.To make the patties, combine one half of the beans and one half of the rice in a food processor. Add the oil and salsa and process until mostly smooth. Combine with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Form into 8 patties with your hands. I roughly measured them as 1/3 cup of patty mix each. Wrap in waxed paper or parchment paper and let freeze in a container or on a flat surface in a plastic bag.
To make the bitty burger buns, combine the warm water, agave, and yeast and whisk until combined, just a few seconds. Let stand 10 minutes until proofed. Combine with the remaining ingredients and mix until dough forms. Knead until smooth. Add more flour if too sticky. I added an additional two tablespoons. I also used my standing mixer for this, using the dough hook of course. I let the machine knead the dough for 3-4 minutes. If kneading by hand you may be looking at 5-7 minutes instead. Roll to a 1/2 inch thickness, then cut with a biscuit cutter into 12-16 rounds.
Sprinkle cornmeal on a couple of cookie sheets. Place the buns on the cookie sheets. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for one hour. Bake at 375 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until browned on top.
When ready for the burgers, lightly oil a non-stick grill pan. Preheat over medium high heat. Cook each patty for 5-7 minutes, pushing down with a spatula occasionally for nice grill marks. Gently flip and cook for the same amount of time on the other side.
You don’t have to make all of the patties at once. Just keep them in the refrigerator until you’re ready for another!
Garnish with lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado, pickles, you name it.

Meanwhile, finely shred ½ of the pear(s) and the radishes. Add 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp plum extract to the prepared pear and radishes, and mix well with your hands.
Grate the remainder of the pears and sieve or strain to collect juice. Add the purified water, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp plum extract and a pinch of salt to the juice.
Cut the cucumber into 3cm cylindrical pieces and make cross-cuts on the circular face of each piece. Stuff the cucumbers with the radish and pear mixture and transfer to a plate.

1 cucumber
1 large avocado
8 French radishes
75g watercress
1 bunch dill, washed
Salt and pepper to seasonDipping sauce:1 large orange, juiced
25ml soy sauce","To make the dipping sauce place the orange juice in a pan on a low heat for 7-8 minutes so it reduces by around two thirds. Take of the heat and mix with the soy sauce. Place in a small bowl and set aside to cool.
Take the cucumber and slice into thin strips using a julienne peeler or sharp knife. Only cut the outer flesh of the cucumber discarding the more watery core.
Halve and peel the avocado, remove the stone and slice lengthways in half inch slices. Slice the radishes lengthways.
Fill a bowl with slightly warm water. The diameter of the bowl needs to be wider than the rice paper so that the rice paper can be fully immersed in the water.
Dunk one rice paper in the bowl of water for 5 seconds. Give it a shake to get rid of excess water and lay on a clean chopping board.
Near one of the edges of the paper place a handful or two of the watercress tearing any larger clumps into smaller sections as the rolls are meant to be eaten by hand.
Next, place two or three slices of the avocado on top of the watercress. Then, take a few sprigs of dill and, using a pair of scissors, chop finely over the avocado and watercress and season with salt and pepper.
Fold the near edge the wrapper over the contents, then fold both sides into the middle and roll up.

Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl combine the flour and oats.
When the margarine mixture is ready pour into the flour and oats and mix well. The mixture will look like rough bread crumbs rather than a dough so don’t panic if it feel a little dry.
Spoon half the mix into the prepared tin and press down well to form the base of the slice. Next spread the mincemeat over in an even layer. Sprinkle over the remaining flour mixture and place into the oven.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until the top is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and cool.
Cut into pieces and enjoy. Best served with a spoon of vanilla soya yogurt and a cup of Earl Grey.Quick dull health and safety note: The mincemeat achieves a temperature close to lava so don’t give in to temptation and try and sample too soon!! Let it cool for a good ten minutes at least.

422,"Mexican Plate, with Chilli, Guacamole, Refried Beans and Black Rice","Black Rice
1 x can of refried beans
Guacamole:
2 ripe avocados
Red onion (about half a small one)
Stalk of spring onion 
1 x red chilli 
 6-8 cherry tomatoes 
Juice of about half a lemon
Salt and cracked pepper
Chilli Non Carne (recipe link in Instructions)","What’s on the plate?
Black Rice – I’ve been obsessed with this ever since I was introduced to it by Jane, and I love the fact that it has bite and is really easy to cook. 1 part rice to 2 parts water, bring to boil, turn down and simmer for 40 minutes. Works perfectly every time. I buy the Biona black rice, but you should be able to find it in most supermarkets.
Refried Beans – I’ve been a refried bean fan ever since I was a kid. Great in nachos as well, but lovely here because of their creamy flavour. You buy it in cans, and you’ll find them in the Mexican section.
Guacamole – I always make my own, as it is so much tastier, really easy and doesn’t have any sour cream sneaked in (many store-made guacs do, so always check the label before you buy). My ‘go-to’ recipe is this:Mash up 2 ripe avocados with a fork
Finely dice some red onion (about half a small one) and a stalk of spring onion – add to bowl
Finely dice one red chilli (up to you if you keep the seeds or not!) – add to bowl
Chop up about 6-8 cherry tomatoes into little pieces (in half and then in half again at least) – add to bowl
Squeeze in the juice of about half a lemon – do this to taste. You can always add more lemon, so start off with a little first
Salt and cracked pepperIf you don’t have any fresh chilli then you can use a hot sauce, like Tabasco, instead. And if you’re not keen on heat, then just leave the chilli out altogether.

1 medium onion
3 garlic cloves
1/4 thumb ginger
100g cherry tomatoes
1/2 small butternut squash
2 medium potatoes
Large handful of coriander
100g frozen peas
80g baby spinach leaves
1 pot of Tideford Organics Vegan Rogan Josh (or similar)
1/2 lime
Salt and pepper
2 x 320g sheets of gluten-free puff pastry
4 tsp gluten-free plain flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tbsp plant milk of your choice
 
","4 springform pie tins approx. 11cm in diameterHeat the coconut oil in a large pan on a medium heat. While the pan heats up, peel and discard the skin of the onion, slice it thinly and add it to the pan. Fry for 10 minutes, stirring frequently until it begins to caramelise.
Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the ginger and garlic. Then peel and dice the butternut squash and potatoes. Quarter the cherry tomatoes and finely chop the stalks of the coriander, saving the leaves for later. Add the ginger, garlic, squash, potatoes, tomatoes and coriander stalks to the pan and fry for a further 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the frozen peas, spinach leaves and Rogan Josh Curry Sauce to the frying pan and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Next, roughly chop the coriander leaves and stir them into the pan along with the juice from the half of lime and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat the oven to 200°C fan.
Meanwhile, roll out the pastry on a floured surface until it’s a few millimetres thick. Use a sharp knife to cut 4 circles a few cms wider than the pie tins (make sure you leave enough pastry for the tops), then line the pie tins with the pastry by pressing the pastry into the base and sides to ensure the inside of the tin is fully covered.
Sprinkle a tsp of flour over the base to stop it from going soggy, then fill each pie with the curry filling.
Use the remaining pastry to cover each pie and pinch the top and sides of the pastry together to close the pie.
Brush the tops with plant milk and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.
Serve with chips and mushy peas. Enjoy!If you’ve been inspired by this recipe, check out this Lentil and Mushroom pie!

5 – 6 large field mushrooms or around 10 smaller variety mushrooms. Chestnut mushrooms are lovely as they have a nice nutty flavour. Slice thickly
A pack of Fry’s thick-cut chunky strips (or other beef substitute)
Bisto original gravy granules or other vegan granules
A cup of Vegan ale – Check Barnivore, a great vegan alcohol website. If you don’t drink alcohol, replace with water.","Fry the onion and garlic, herbs and seasoning in some oil until a little soft.
Add the mushrooms and “meat” strips and fry until the strips start to look browned
Add the ale and sprinkle in the gravy granules, a tablespoon at a time until it starts to thicken. Make sure the gravy isn’t watery, as it will make the pastry really soggy. It just needs to cover the ingredients in the pan.
Roll out the pastry, line a roasting dish with it and place the pie filling in the dish. Place the pastry on the top and squash the edges of the bottom layer and the top of the pie together with a fork. If you want less pastry, you can leave off the bottom layer and just have the top. Don’t worry if it looks a mess, when the pastry puffs up, it will look fab! And if the gravy overflows and runs out, even better!
Cook at 200 degrees for about half an hour, or until the pastry looks nice and brown.If you’ve been inspired by this recipe, why not sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.

Add any other veg you want to include and stir.
Now, take the books off the tofu and give the tea towel another squeeze. Then with your hands, crumble the tofu into the frying pan.
Mix the tofu through, using your spoon to break up any bigger bits. It should look similar to scrambled egg now.
Once all mixed in, add nutritional yeast and mix in. I am obsessed with nutritional yeast so I always add more than 2!
Add some pepper and mix again.
Leave to cook for another 20 mins or so, turning down the heat a little to stop it sticking. Give it a stir occasionally.
After about 20 minutes you can start to prep your tortilla wraps. Spread some tomato salsa in the middle of the wrap. Add sliced avocado or a little homemade guacamole on top, and then sprinkle on some grated vegan cheese. Then pile some scramble on top of the cheese and add sliced spring onions and jalapenos on top.
Wrap up and serve with extra avocado and Frank’s hot sauce.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160213_125006-400x400.jpg,12,14
449,Chocolate and Peanut Butter ‘Freakshake’,"150g (2/3 cup) nut milk (hazelnut or almond work really well here)
1 banana
1 heaped tbsp peanut butter
1 scoop dairy-free vanilla ice cream
1 tsp cocoa powder
1 tbsp maple syrup
100g (3.5 oz) plain/dark chocolate chips CHECK THE LABEL
Handful sweet popcorn","Place the nut milk, banana, peanut butter, ice cream, cocoa powder, maple syrup and about a third of the chocolate chips into a blender or food processor, and blitz until smooth and creamy, (this may take up to a minute).
Set aside about a tablespoon full of the remaining chocolate chips, and pour the rest into a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on full power for one minute until melted, and whisk with a fork until smooth.
Dip the rim of your glass into the melted chocolate, then use a teaspoon to drizzle more of the chocolate around the rim to create the trademark Freakshake dribbles around the outside.
Pour in the milkshake, then top with as much popcorn as gravity will allow, scatter carefully with the chocolate chips, and then drizzle the whole lot with even more melted chocolate.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Choc-freakshake-cropped-jpg-400x600.jpg,1,19
450,Spicy Roasted Chickpeas With Rosemary And Sumac,"1 tin chickpeas

2 tsp oil (coconut or rice bran)","Heat the oven to180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.Drain and rinse the chickpeas and set about peeling them (I think it’s worth it, for extra crunch). Shakingthem in acolander or rolling between sheets of kitchen paper seems to help loosen the skins.
Either place all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix them together until the chickpeas are nicely coated, or make a little bag with parchment paper to shake it all together (making sure you’ve gathered all the edges together!). My preferred method is to use the parchment paper, as it means you’re not left with an oily bowl to wash up.
Spread the chickpeas out on a sheet of parchment paper on a baking tray. I use the same sheet of paper from step 3. 5. Cook for 20 minutes, give them a little shake, then cook for a further 20 minutes.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_3030-400x267.jpg,14,506

1 cup diced parsnip
Freshly grated ginger juice to taste (approximately 1 tbsp)
Shoyu/soy sauce to taste","Discard the water from the soaking beans and add fresh filtered water. Bring water with adzuki beans and kombu to a boil over medium-high heat.
Reduce heat to medium and cook for 30-45 minutes until beans are soft.
(Discard this part of the recipe if you are using canned beans – see below.)

1 garlic clove
1/2 tbsp olive or coconut oil
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp turmeric
Black pepper to taste","Makes 1 large jar
EquipmentFood processor
Frying pan
Wooden spoon
Bowl and water for soaking the cashews
Measuring cups
Chopping board and knifePut the cashews into a bowl, cover with cold water and allow to soak for 30 mins. Remove the pepper from the jar so it’s ready to use, or roast a fresh pepper if you prefer.
Roughly chop the onion and garlic and fry gently for 5-10 mins in the oil, so they soften and turn golden. Add the turmeric and paprika after a couple of minutes of cooking.
* Time Saving Tip *
You can add the onion and garlic raw if you prefer, but I found that my loved ones weren’t shy about telling me how strongly it smelled!
Drain the cashews and add to the processor with the cooked onions, garlic, roasted pepper, water and lemon juice or vinegar. Blitz together on high-speed, stopping every so often to scrape down the sides. Keep blending until a smooth texture has formed and then get a (big) tasting spoon to try it. Add black pepper and (if needed) salt, and give it another quick whizz.
* Serving Suggestion *
You’re now ready to enjoy this creamy goodness on crackers or open sandwiches. It’s also perfect for mixing through cooked pasta and veggies, serves as a great dip alternative to hummus, plus any other tasty combinations you discover! Store in an airtight jar, and it will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.

I use brown rice here, but any cooked grain you have will do – quinoa, pearl barley and farro all work well.
I like to make a quick pickled cucumber to top these with. Thinly slice a quarter of a cucumber and pop it into a bowl with a pinch of salt, a squeeze of agave syrup, and a good tablespoon of white wine vinegar, then scrunch together and leave to sit while you make your burgers. A homemade quick pickle that beats a gherkin any day. 🙂Like this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.

Next, drain the white beans and put them into a food processor with the dates, garlic, parsley, tahini and soy sauce. Pulse until you have a smoothish mixture, then transfer to a bowl and add the rice, breadcrumbs, lemon zest and the cooled mushrooms. Mix well, then put into the fridge for 10 minutes or so to firm up.
Once cooled, divide the mixture into 8 portions and shape into 8 patties. Place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper and pop into the fridge until needed. (This can be done the day before – and the burgers freeze well at this point.)
Preheat your oven to 230°C/fan 210°C/gas 8 and bake the burgers for 15 minutes, until nicely brown. If you like cheese on your burger, pop a slice on top a couple of minutes before they come out of the oven.
While your burgers are cooking, get your toppings ready. I go with avocado, tomato relish and the quick cucumber pickle above, plus a few spinach leaves. Hummus, grated carrot and sprouts is another favourite, but feel free to improvise and try it your own way.
Once the burgers are golden, toast your buns and layer up your burgers. I like to serve them with the sweet potato fries. You can’t beat a burger and chips, and these ones are as healthy as they are tasty.

469,Spiced Apple Blondies,"For the spiced apple:
1 bramley apple
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp ginger
½ tsp nutmeg
1 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp water
For the blondie mix:
1 tin chickpeas
1 tbsp flax seeds, 3 tbsp water
2 tsp coconut oil (solid)
1 tbsp maple syrup
8 dates, pitted
50g organic sultanas (oil-free)
2 tbsp desiccated coconut
10 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp baking powder
½ tsp Himalayan pink salt
1 tbsp chia seeds, to decorate","Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutesHeat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.
Prepare the flax ‘egg’ by combining the flax seeds and water in a bowl and popping it in the fridge for around 15 minutes.
Put the coconut oil into a ramekin and heat in the oven for 5 minutes, until melted.
Peel and core the apple and chop it into small pieces. In a saucepan, cook on a medium heat with the maple syrup, water and spices. Simmer until you have something resembling apple puree, stirring occasionally to ensure the maple syrup isn’t burning and most of the water has evaporated. Set aside to cool.
While the apple is cooking you can start to make the blonde mix. Drain and rinse the chickpeas and put these, together with the dates and the flax egg, into a mixing bowl. Use an electronic hand blender or processor to combine.
If you need to, use a little of the melted oil to grease a brownie tin and add the rest to the blondie mix.
Stir in the remaining ingredients, except the chia seeds. If the mixture looks too dry you can add a tbsp of non-dairy milk (this will depend on the amount of moisture in your apple puree).
Pour the mixture into a brownie tin and spread evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the chia seeds across the top and bake in the oven for 25 minutes.
Once cooled, remove from the tin to a cooling rack. Slice into squares and store in the fridge: they will firm up and keep for longer.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/apple-blondies-6-400x267.jpg,16,601

475,Cool Sesame & Dino Kale Yuba Noodles,"1 pack of Hodo Yuba sheets
1 bunch of lacinato kale
1/3 cup tahini
1/3 cup rice vinegar
4 T gluten-free tamari
2 t sesame oil
1 t sugar
1/3 T salt
7g ginger
5 cloves garlic
Optional to garnish: julienned cucumbers, toasted sesame seeds, chopped parseley and/or cilantro, red chili flakes","Remove Yuba from packet and place on cutting board. (There’s no need to unfold the sheets, but if you are unfamiliar with the yuba, there are two folded sheets in the pack, FYI!) Cut yuba to desired width, like you would with regular pasta – for this dish, I prefer about 1/2″ wide noodles. Toss cut yuba into a large mixing bowl and pull apart to separate.
Rinse the kale and strip the main vein out, reserve to snack on, stir-fry or pickle! Cut similarly to the yuba noodles in width (hint: cut lengthwise to get longer rather than shorter strips.) Toss chopped kale in with the yuba and set aside.
For the sesame sauce, these are the basic ingredient quantities, but as always, adjust to taste! (You can use this sauce with anything, by the way, regular noodles, as a dipping sauce for veggies & tofu, etc etc etc.) Peel ginger and grate, conserving the liquid as well. Peel and mince the garlic (I tend to drop both ginger and garlic into the food processor at the same time and mince into almost a paste.) Add all other ingredients and puree together.
Add sauce to yuba and kale and mix well! Garnish as you like. As a side dish, serves 4-6 and as a main, 2-3.
Sesame sauce can be prepared up to a few days in advance. The salad can be prepared a day in advance – yuba and kale both hold up very well, and the kale actually softens up a bit with time! (Perfect for picnic planning.)",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_3345-400x400.jpg,18,97

OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS
1 tsp baobab superfruit powder
1 tsp camu berry powder
Goji berries (to garnish)","Throw all the ingredients in a blender.Whizz until smooth. Taste and adjust if required. This smoothie is sweet enough for my palate, but it you want it sweeter, you can add ½ tsp agave or date syrup or a few drops of stevia.Pour into a glass. Decorate with a few goji berries and serve.

1 x pack of stir fry vegetable mix
1/2 packet of kale
1 x pack of marinated tofu","Pour some boiling water from the kettle into a pan, put on a low heat and chuck in your edamame beans (these need approx. 5 minutes to cook and should only be on a simmer, never a boil)

479,"Roast Potatoes with Peppers, Garlic and Creamy Tahini Sauce","1kg floury potatoes – I recommend Maris Pipers or King Edwards
4 tbsp olive oil
5 cloves of garlic
3 stems of rosemary
1 jar of roasted peppers in oil
For the tahini sauce:
1 tbsp tahini, light or dark
2 tbsp water
1 tbsp olive oil – or use the oil from the jar of peppers
1 tsp cider vinegar, or 1 tbsp lemon juice 
1 tsp maple syrup","Serves 4, as an accompanimentPeel and cut the potatoes into large bite size chunks. Place them in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil and then leave at a rolling simmer for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the oil into a large mixing bowl and add the garlic cloves (skin on) and a generous pinch of sea salt.
Drain the potatoes and then tip into the bowl of oil and garlic. Mix together, not minding if the potatoes mar on the edges – this will add to their crispness later. Tip the potatoes onto a baking tray, scatter over the rosemary and roast for 1 hour in the oven or until golden and crunchy.
While the potatoes are roasting, make up the tahini sauce. Place the tahini and water into a bowl and stir together until completely smooth. Pour in the oil, cider vinegar (or lemon juice if using), maple syrup and season with salt and pepper. Stir together until you have a smooth and creamy sauce. Taste and add any extra seasoning if you think it needs it.
When the potatoes are ready, and crisp and golden, tip them out onto a serving platter, discarding the rosemary stalks and taking the roasted garlic cloves and squeezing the soft garlic interior into the tahini sauce. Now scatter over the peppers and mix with the potatoes, before drizzling over the tahini sauce and serving immediately.

482,A Great Big Lunchtime Salad Bowl,"2 x baby gem lettuce
Half a (large) bag of kale
1 x red pepper
1 x green pepper
3 x celery stalks
About 10cm of cucumber
2 x gherkins
A good handful of kalamata and green olives
Half a bag of ready-to-eat puy lentils
1 x packet of Cauldron marinated tofu (or similar by another brand)
Balsamic vinegar
Olive oil
Sunflower seeds (toasted)
Salt and pepper to taste","Serves 2 as a big lunch, or 4 if having something with it – like bread and (more) olives, and other tapas-y things.
You can really do this in any particular order. Ultimately it all gets mixed up!In a fry pan chuck a good handful or two of sunflower seeds and dry fry. You want them slightly browned, so they have a lovely nutty taste. Put them to the side while you do the rest
Rip up the lettuce heads into a colander and wash. Then add the kale and wash, massaging as you go. (Massaging kale seems hilarious at first, but it does help it to soften, and basically you’re just rubbing it between your fingers. When I first started eating raw kale I found it quite tough, so the more you massage it then softer it gets. If the kale is very fresh you may hardly need to do this. It really is a case of personal taste. I don’t notice the toughness of kale in the same way I used to, because I eat it such a lot.) Rip the kale and lettuce into smaller pieces, and discard any woody kale stalks
Chop up your peppers, celery, cucumber, gherkins, olives and chuck in a big bowl
Add the puy lentils and marinated tofu and mix well
Add the lettuce and kale bit by bit, mixing as you go. A good salad is one where you get a bit of everything, so try to evenly distribute
Add the sunflower seeds, a good splash of olive oil and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar
Crack pepper over the top and a little salt if you think it needs it
Serve in big bowls and enjoy!Additions:Crusty bread, hummus, more olives, guacamole, aubergine dip ora tomato, red onion and basil salad all go well with this. Create a table of colour with the salad as the centre piece! Also perfect picnic grub on a lovely summer day. This is a filling salad though, and delicious just as it is.

4. To make the sauce, roughly chop the onion and garlic cloves. Then chop the ginger,
slightly smaller than the onion and garlic. Then add to a blender and blend until smooth.
5. To make the sauce add some oil to a pan on a medium heat. Add the paste, making sure to stir often. If it begins to stick you can add a little water. Cook until golden brown.

Then add a little more water and leave on a low heat, stirring occasionally.
6. Remove the skins from roasted squash pieces.

485,Summer Rolls,"1 small red cabbage
2 carrots
1 cucumber
Bunch of spring onions
Bunch of fresh coriander
1 or 2 limes
Soy sauce
Marinated tofu (either pre-bought or homemade)
Crushed peanuts
Dipping sauce of your choice (sweet chilli, sriracha etc)
1 pack of rice paper","The key to this recipe is the preparation, which only takes about 10 minutes, so first things first get your veggies and condiments ready and arranged in front of you.Shred the cabbage and carrot, if you have a food processor with a slicer attachment then that’s perfect, otherwise julienne or grate them.
Cut the cucumber into inch-long lengths and then match-stick them.
Cut the spring onions into inch-long lengths and then cut into quarters.
Smash up the peanuts (use plain, non-roasted with no skins).
Cut the limes into quarters (if you bash them on the work surface before cutting them you’ll get more juice out).
Get the marinated tofu out and ready in front of you.
Roughly chop the coriander.Making these is a bit like a production line, so arrange all of the above in a way that all the pieces are accessible, then open the rice paper and get a large, shallow dish and fill it with warm water.
1) Soak one sheet of rice paper in the warm water until it becomes pliable, but not totally floppy. This should be about 10 – 20 seconds; it’ll continue to soften up once you take it out of the water.
2) Lay the sheet of rice paper in front of you, and then add into the middle of the rice paper in a line, the cabbage, carrot, cucumber and spring onion, tofu, a pinch of peanuts and coriander and a squeeze of lime. The trick here is to not overfill them as you’re going to roll them up.
3) Fold in the left and right sides of the rice paper, then fold up the bottom to cover the ingredients (think of making an envelope), then roll the rice paper and ingredients to make a roll.
4) Place on a plate and repeat steps 1-3 until you have enough summer rolls.
5) Serve with additional lime and coriander and with a selection of dipping sauces.

A few mint leaves, torn to shreds
2 Tbsp maple syrup or coconut nectar","Makes 2 sandwichesSpread a small amount of butter on one side of each slice of bread, make sure it is room temp and spreadable.
Smear almond butter over the unbuttered side of two of the pieces of bread. Top with a generous amount of fresh berries in any artistic way you like, add a few mint leaves, don’t be shy about piling them on.Drizzle maple syrup on top of the berries and place theother slice of bread, buttered side up, on top.

½ tsp ground coriander
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp smoked paprika
¼ tsp ground cloves

2 x 400g tins peeled plum tomatoes
1 Tbsp light brown sugar
500ml vegetable stock
Juice of 1 lemon
For the Flatbreads:
130g strong white bread flour
350g plain white flour
1 tsp fine sea salt
300ml lukewarm water
2 tsp quick yeast
1 tsp sugar","To Make the Stew:Preheat the oven to 200c (fan).
Place a cast-iron dutch oven (with lid) over a medium/low heat and add the oil.
Once the pan is to temperature, add the onion and fry lightly for a minute. Add the garlic and parsley stalks before frying for a further 2 minutes. Do not allow the onions or garlic to brown.
Add the spices and stir well to coat the onion. Add the aubergine, chickpeas, tinned tomatoes, brown sugar, and vegetable stock. Stir well.
Cover the pot with the lid and place in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, removing to stir every half hour.
While the stew cooks, make the flatbreads.To Make the Flatbreads:Combine the flours and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. If you don’t have a stand mixer, just use a medium sized bowl.
Place 100 ml of the water into a small bowl and add the sugar and yeast. Mix well and set aside to allow the yeast to bloom.
Mix the yeast mixture into the flour along with the rest of the water. If using a stand mixer, knead using the dough hook attachment for roughly 8-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth. If kneading by hand, sprinkle a counter with flour and knead vigorously for 8-10 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea-towel and leave to proof somewhere room temperature for at least one hour.
Once proofed, punch down the dough to remove the larger air bubbles.
Lightly flour a rimmed baking tray. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and slice the dough into 8 even pieces. Roll them into tight balls and place on the floured tray to prove, covered with a damp tea-towel. Leave to proof a second time for around 40 minutes.
Once proofed, roll out each ball to around 15cm. Place a dry, cast-iron skillet over medium heat.
Place one flatbread in the skillet and cook until puffed and bubbly. Flip after around 3 minutes, making sure the bottom isn’t burning. Cook for a further minute or two on the second side before removing. Repeat with all of the flatbreads.

504,Vegan Kebab Skewers with Grilled Peaches and Vegan Tzatziki,"Serves 3-4
3-4 large ripe peaches
1 pack Oumph! Kebab Spiced (280g)
For the glaze:
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp tamari soy sauce
¼ tsp crushed black pepper
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
For the tzatziki dip:
1 large cucumber, shredded
2 tsp salt
350g dairy-free yoghurt
Juice of 1 lemon
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tbsp fresh dill
To serve:
Toasted fresh pita breads.
","Fire up your BBQ and wait 30 minutes until the coals are glowing and hot, hot, hot.
In the meantime, wash and half the peaches and allow for the Oumph! Kebab Spiced to defrost, and pierce them onto skewers. If you’re using wooden skewers on your BBQ then make sure to soak them in water for at least an hour before using.
For the glaze, simply mix maple syrup, tamari, black pepper and rapeseed oil in a small bowl, then brush your skewers with the glaze before placing them onto the hot BBQ. Turn the skewers regularly until the peaches are starting to caramelise and the kebab is lightly browned.
To prepare the tzatziki dip, finely shred the cucumber with a grater or a food processor, then transfer the shreds to a nut milk bag or a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much of the water as you can.

1 onion, chopped
1 -2 tablespoons of oil
250ml of vegan gravy (keep it quite thick). If you can’t find any, then you could use vegetable stock and gravy browning.
1 Tbsp. ketchup
2 teaspoons Henderson’s relish (or vegan Worcestershire sauce)
Black pepper (to taste, I used a lot)
1⁄2 teaspoon oregano
1 pack of ready to roll shortcrust pastry (Jus-Rol is vegan)
1 pack of ready to roll puff pastry (Jus-Rol is vegan) 
","The filling can also be frozen and then used at a future date.
The filling:Finely chop the onion and soften in a large pan with the oil.Once softened, add the soya mince and cook-off, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. The kind of soya mince I used needed to be rehydrated first so make sure you follow the instructions for that. If you are using frozen, break it up a bit and add it to the pan.Add in the gravy, ketchup, Henderson’s, pepper and oregano to the pan. Stir it all together then cook over a medium heat. Try to reduce the mixture down so that it’s not too wet. You should be able to drag a spoon through the pan and have the mixture stay apart for a few seconds.This can then be refrigerated until you are ready to use it. It will freeze too so you can make lots this time and then defrost ahead of time in the future.The pie:Get your pie dish or dishes ready and roll out the shortcrust pastry as per the instructions so you have enough to cover the bottom and the sides of your dish. This is a proper pie, not a stew with a puff pastry hat on.Line the bottom and sides of your dish with the pastry and then blind bake at 200C for around 15 mins until the pastry turns golden. You can prick the pastry on the bottom of the pan with a knife to stop it rising up and help it cook a little better.While your pastry is blind baking, you can roll out your puff pastry for the top as per the instructions on the packet.Once your shortcrust is ready, add the filling and then place the puff pastry on top. Crimp around the edges and then make a couple of holes in the top with a sharp knife to let the steam out.Brush with soya milk (or other non-sweet plant milk) and bake at 200C for around 30 mins or until the top is lovely and golden.Want more recipes just like this?

510,Chilli Non Carne,"Olive Oil
1 x large onion (white or red)
3 x cloves of garlic
Teaspoon of cumin powder
Teaspoon of coriander
Good splash of soy sauce
Good squirt of tomato puree
2 x carrots
2 x celery stalks
Half a teaspoon (or more if you like spice) of cayenne pepper
Half a teaspoon of smoked paprika
Good splash of your favourite hot sauce (optional)
1 x tin chickpeas
1 x tin kidney beans
1 x tin cannellini beans
2 x tins of chopped tomatoes
Salt and pepper to taste","Serves 4, or 2 with leftovers
This is a meal that you will make again and again, so use my ingredients as a guide and experiment with what you like best. I also like it hot, so go easy on the cayenne, paprika and hot sauce if you’re not a fan. You can choose whatever beans you like, but I recommend 3 x tins whatever combination you choose. This is a hearty meal, and one that tastes better the next day. Great on toast for lunch!Put a good splash of olive oil in a pot and get it on a low/medium heat
Chop up your onion and toss in the pot
Chop up your garlic and throw in after a couple of minutes
Add your cumin, coriander, paprika and cayenne and mix well
Add your soy sauce and tomato puree and mix
Chop up your carrots and put them in (I typically slice them down the middle, down the middle again, and then across into little chunks)
Then goes your celery, chopped, but not too fine (the carrot and celery add texture and a bit of crunch)
Open your tins of beans, pour into a colander and rinse well in cold water
Add all the beans to the pot and mix well
Add the 2 x tins of tomatoes and mix again
Salt and pepper to taste and then leave simmering away for a good 30 minutes
Taste before serving – if it tastes great then you’re ready!If you make in advance, leave simmering for 30 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, and then let it sit covered for a few hours. Heat up again before serving. These flavours love getting to know each other, so a little time is never a bad thing.

514,Coconut Bacon,"2 tablespoons liquid smoke (hickory or mesquite flavor)
2 tablespoons tamari soy sauce
1 tablespoon maple syrup or agave nectar
1 tablespoon water
3½ cups (200 g) unsweetened coconut flakes","Makes 3½ cups
Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, stir together the liquid smoke, tamari soy sauce, maple syrup or agave nectar, and water.
Add the coconut flakes to the bowl, and using a rubber spatula, gently toss together the coconut with the liquid mixture until the coconut flakes are thoroughly coated.
Transfer the coated coconut flakes onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading them out in a single layer so they cook evenly, and place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, and stay close by.
After 10 or 15 minutes and every 5 minutes thereafter, you will want to toss and flip the flakes using a spatula. This is not only to make sure the flakes cook evenly but also to ensure that they don’t burn, and they will burn if you don’t regularly toss them.
Depending on your oven, you may also need to turn the baking sheet around to ensure they cook up evenly. As you continue to check, feel free to taste to make sure they’re nice and crispy. They will be a nice brown color when they’re done, and if you test them, you’ll notice the coconut flavor is pretty much gone.
Remove from the oven, and let cool before storing in a sealed bag or container. (They continue to crisp up as they cool.) The coconut bacon will stay fresh for up to 3 weeks—in or out of the refrigerator.
Suggestions for ServingMake a classic Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato Sandwich with some avocado slices!
Top a baked potato with a couple tablespoons, as you would with bacon bits.
Offer the coconut bacon as an option for a salad topping.
It’s a great garnish for soup.
Sprinkle them on top of your favorite Macaroni & Cheese recipe or on top of pasta.For Your Information
Look for unsweetened coconut flakes in the bulk section of your grocery store; packaged brands include Edward & Sons/Let’s Do Organic and Bob’s Red Mill (USA only).
For Your Edification
Liquid smoke adds a wonderful depth of flavor to so many dishes, and a little goes a long way. It’s a great staple to keep in the cupboard, and you’ll find yourself using it often to add a smoky flavor to your favorite recipes.

521,Mediterranean-Style Roasted Miniature Aubergines,"6 miniature aubergines
6 cloves garlic
minced
2 tsp lemon juice
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp dried oregano","If you’re not able to find this variety of aubergine in your local shop, substitute with two regular aubergines sliced in half and cook for a little longer.
Note: I don’t often cook with extra virgin olive oil – I think it’s better for dressings or for dipping with bread- but the aubergines in this recipe really soak up the flavour, so I think it’s worthwhile.
For this recipe, use a good non-stick roasting tray, or line a tray with parchment paper.Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Slice off the stalk end from each aubergine and then slice each one in half lengthways.
Add the minced garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and oregano to the tray and give it all a good stir, spreading it evenly across the surface.
Arrange the aubergine halves on the tray, flesh-side down, ensuring all have a good coating of the oil mixture.
Cook for 25 minutes. When you remove them after this time the skins should be slightly wrinkly.
Turn each half over, cover the tray with tin foil and return to cook for a further 20-25 minutes.
The aubergines are just right when they’re starting to dissolve slightly, but still hold their shape.I love to eat this dish with a fresh tomato, red onion, olive and basil salad and some lovely bread to soak up the juices. You could even scoop out the flesh and mash it together to create a ready-made baba ghanoush!

522,"Moroccan-Style Lentil, Chickpea and Kale Soup","Good slug of olive oil
1 x large onion (red or white, whatever you prefer/have in the cupboard)
3/4 big cloves of garlic, finely chopped
A good chunk of ginger, peeled and diced finely (about the same amount in total as the garlic)
1 x large lemon
Teaspoon of cumin
Half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper
3/4 sundried tomatoes from a jar (chopped as finely as you can get them)
Handful of cherry tomatoes
1 x cup of red lentils
1 x tin of chickpeas
1 x tin of chopped tomatoes
Good few handfuls of kale, washed and chopped
2 x cups of vegan veggie stock (I use Bouillon)
1 x cup of water
Cracked pepper to taste","Moroccan Lentil, Chickpea and Kale Soup. A hearty vegan soup, packed full of protein.
I’m a bit of a chuck-it-in-and-taste as I go kind of girl, so please forgive the lack of ‘absoluteness’ with this recipe. But this really is a soup you will make your own, so adapt the flavours to suit your own tastes. I like spicy food, so maybe go easy on the cayenne for the first run…Put some olive oilin apan and get it on a low heat
Chop up your onion and chuck in the pan
Chop/mince up your garlic and ginger and add to the pan
Add the cumin and cayenne and stir well
Wash your lemon and chop into fairly chunky slices – I pretty much use the entire lemon as I just love the flavour, but you may want to use three slices to begin with – and add to the pan
Add the finely chopped sundried tomatoes and mix in
In a separate bowl, wash your lentils and drain – set aside
In a colander, empty 1 tin of chickpeas and wash well
Add the lentils to the pan and mix well
Add the chickpeas to the pan and mix well
Cut your cherry tomatoes into quarters and add to the mix
Open a can of chopped tomatoes and pour into the pan – mix well
In order to get out the remaining tomato/juice from the can, fill with cold water and pour into the pan (roughly 1 cup of water)
Add enough water to the kettle for two more cups and switch on
Mix up your veggie stock and add to the pan
Mix well and cover with lid, leave covered for approximately 10 minutes (this gives you time to tidy/wash up what you’ve used so far)
Put kale in colander and wash. Leave on side, ready for later
The soup needs about 20/30 mins to thicken (lid off), and needs stirring every now and then. It should be simmering hot, but not boiling
When you are happy that it’s pretty much ready, roughly chop your kale and add to the soup
Simmer for an additional 5 minutes or so and then your soup is ready to serve
Add pepper to taste or for garnish
Dig in!This is lovely served with Marmite and Violife cheese on hot/toasted ciabatta, and makes a delicious filling lunch the next day. Packed with flavour, protein and goodness, this is a soup I make as soon as I feel the hint of a sniffle… Add extra cayenne, garlic and ginger to blast that cold right away!

523,Easy Peasy Banana Ice Cream,"3 large bananas
Plant milk (only a little)
Vegan chocolate for melting
Chopped nuts","Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image: split-pin.co.ukPeel and chop the bananas into thick slices
Lay flat on a tray or plate, and place in freezer for at least two hours
Just before the two hours is up, melt some chocolate in a pan, and crush/chop your nuts
Put frozen banana slices in a blender and whizz – you will need to stop and give it a stir with a spoon/break up bananas a few times, as it takes a while for them to stop being more than just icy slices
Almost suddenly it will become creamy like ice cream… If you’re not seeing this, add a dash or two of plant milk and blend until it does
This is best served almost immediately, so spoon into bowls, pour on melted chocolate, sprinkle on the nuts, and serve

529,Bedeviled Eggless Eggs,"Ingredients for the “egg whites”:
⅓ block (about 4 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu, pressed 
¾ tsp kala namak (Himalayan black salt)
2 cups water
2 and ¼ tsp agar powder or 3 T agar flakes
Ingredients for the “yolk” filling:
⅔ block (about 8 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu, pressed 
3 tbsp vegan mayonnaise
1 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes
1 tbsp dill pickle brine
2 tsp Dijon mustard or spicy golden mustard
½ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp kala namak* (Himalayan black salt), or more to taste
¼ tsp turmeric
¼ tsp paprika (for extra bedeviling, use cayenne pepper)
Garnishes:
Paprika and coarse ground black pepper
Optional: sliced black olives; fresh snipped chives; capers; chopped cornichons; chopped dill","A blender is required for preparing the “egg whites” and a food processor is recommended for the “yolk filling”. You will also need an 8” square baking pan and 1 block (14 oz) of extra-firm water-packed tofu. If you have chocolate egg molds, or a heat-proof container that specifically holds deviled eggs, the “egg white” mixture can be poured into the molds to create perfect, halved hard-boiled egg shapes. This recipe yields 16 to 24 bedeviled eggless eggs, or more depending upon the mold(s) used for the “egg whites”.Drain and press the tofu until it is not releasing any more liquid – this is very important! After pressing you will have approximately 12 oz of tofu. Slice ⅓ of the tofu to use for the “egg whites. The remaining ⅔ will be used for the “yolk” filling.
To prepare the “egg whites”, place the “egg white” ingredients into a blender and process until smooth. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and bring to rapid simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid scorching the tofu mixture. Pour the mixture into the 8” baking pan and set aside to cool. If you have chocolate egg molds, or a heat-proof container that specifically holds deviled eggs, pour the tofu mixture directly into the molds and set aside to cool.
Next, crumble the ⅔ block of pressed tofu into the food processor and add the remaining “yolk” filling ingredients. Process the contents until completely smooth, stopping as necessary to scrape down the sides of the food processor. Alternately, the mixture can be mashed using a fork or a potato masher/ricer, but the mixture will not be as smooth.
Transfer the “yolk” mixture to a bowl or food storage container, season with additional kala namak if desired, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate until the “egg whites” have completely set, or a minimum of 30 minutes.
Now, run a table knife around the perimeter of the baking pan to loosen the “egg white” (or simply pop them out of the chocolate egg molds). Invert the baking pan onto a clean work surface. At this point, the “egg white” can be cut into rectangles or cut into rounds or ovals.
For rectangles, cut the “egg whites” into 6 even strips. Turn your cutting surface and make 4 even slices. This will create 24 rectangles. For rounds or ovals, use a 1 and ½-inch to 1 and ¾-inch cookie cutter or ring mold. Any “egg white” remnants can be finely diced and mixed with any of the leftover “yolk” filling for a quick eggless egg salad sandwich.
Spoon a generous teaspoonful of the “yolk” mixture onto the top of each “egg white”. Alternately, the mixture can be decoratively piped onto the “egg whites” using a pastry bag. If you don’t have a pastry bag, try placing the mixture into a zip-lock bag, seal and then snip off a tiny piece from the bottom corner of the bag with scissors. Squeeze the bag to pipe the mixture onto the “egg whites”.
Sprinkle with paprika and garnish with optional ingredients as desired. Cover gently with plastic wrap and chill thoroughly before serving.

533,Vegan Chorizo,"Dry ingredients:
1 cup vital wheat gluten
1/4 cup chickpea flour
2 tbsp nutritional yeast
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp hot chili powder
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp white pepper
1 tbsp chilli flakes
4 minced garlic gloves
Wet Ingredients:
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tbsp soy sauce
1/4 tsp liquid smoke
1 tbsp tomato paste
1 cup of vegetable stock (you might not need all of this)","Add all the dry ingredients to a large bowl and mix well with a fork before making a well in the centre.Add the cider vinegar, soya sauce, liquid smoke, tomato paste, and a little of the stock. Different brands of wheat gluten need different amounts of stock so be cautious at first. You can always add but you can’t take away.Mix well with a wooden spoon, adding a little stock as you go until it comes together. You want it to be moist but it requires kneading too so it can’t be too wet. If you add too much stock, you can always add more wheat gluten.Once it has all come together, knead the dough for 5 minutes. You should start to see some stringy bits forming. That is the gluten developing.Once you have done that, divide out the dough in to equal portions. This should make 4 but you can do more or less, depending on how big you want them to be.Roll each piece in to a rough sausage shape and then wrap in tin foil and fold or twist the ends shut. I usually lightly oil the tin foil, just in case they stick. Make sure you go around the sausage a couple of times otherwise they can burst. You don’t have to do it too tightly, the sausage will expand to fill the space.Once you have them all rolled up, put them in a steamer for 45 mins. If you made lots of thin sausages, 35 – 40 mins should be fine. If you made really large sausages then you want to be more like 55 – 60 mins. I turned mine over halfway through the steaming as well.Once they have steamed, let them cool without opening the packages. Put them in the fridge where they will become more solid over a few hours. They last a week or two in the fridge if you don’t open them.Like this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.

Now go, you vegan chef…Preheat oven to 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4 – you will need to put it on for at least 10 minutes to make sure the oven is properly hot before you mix together the pudding batter.

Lightly oil 6 oven-proof ramekin dishes (the white ones are usually fine).
In a medium bowl, mix together the dry ingredients.
In a jug or smaller bowl, whisk together the wet batter ingredients then add to the dry batter ingredients and mix well.

Make the dry sauce by first whisking together the flour and sugar. Sprinkle this DRY mixture quickly and evenly over the batter in each ramekin.
Now very quickly make the wet sauce: mix the lemon/lime juice with the boiling water and pour evenly over each ramekin. Yes, really! DO NOT STIR.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until the tops are golden and the puddings are still slightly gooey inside – test with a toothpick. If using a fan-assisted oven, check after 15 minutes.

538,Creamy Cauliflower Pasta Sauce – Five Ways,"1 small cauliflower (approximately 400g/14oz)
1 can (400ml) of organic coconut milk
3 garlic cloves
1 teaspoon sea salt
3 cardamom pods
1 heaped teaspoon ground coriander
Pinch of pepper (optional)","Make the main sauce:Chop the cauliflower and cook in a large saucepan (with lid) along with the coconut milk (no water). Bring to the boil and then turn down to a simmer.
Take the cardamom seeds out of the pods and chop them with a knife. Chop or crush them as finely as you can (within reason) to unleash their flavour. Toss in the pan.
Peel and crush the garlic cloves and add to the pan along with the salt. Note: If you are using the oven at the same time, roast the garlic first to really bring out the flavour (it’s not essential at all, but it does add a bit of culinary magic if you can).
Simmer for 20 minutes or until you can easily pierce the cauliflower with a fork. Then blend everything together until creamy, using a jug blender or hand blender.
Pour over pasta or noodles and enjoy.Alternative version 1: “Roasted Pepper & Garlic Sauce”Leave out cardamom from the original recipe.
Use 1 sweet pepper and 3 cloves of garlic.
Roast the sweet pepper and garlic in a hot oven… To do this, keep the garlic in its skin and place on an oven tray along with the pepper and place in a pre-heated oven (gas mark 7/425°C/220°F should work fine). Roast garlic for up to 10 minutes and the pepper for about 15-20 minutes (or until the pepper is easy to pierce). No need to let the pepper char.
It’s best to wait until the garlic cools down a little before you pop it out of it’s skin. Gently chop off the top; then squeeze out the fleshy garlic and place in a jug ready to blend with everything else.
Blend in the pepper and garlic with the original recipe and enjoy either creamy smooth or rustic.Alternative version 2: “Mushroom Sauce”Sautee 200g of mushrooms and one medium sized onion in coconut oil and then add to the blended sauce for a chunky mushroom sauce or delicious soup.Alternative version 3: “Scheezy Sauce”Add two heaped tablespoons of nutritional yeast extract for a scheezy sauce.Alternative version 4: “Super Easy Stock Cube Sauce”Leave out the cardamom and sea salt and add a couple of vegan stock cubes for a super easy immediate infusion of flavour.Alternative version 5: “Totally Coconut Sauce”Add up to 100g of creamed coconut block or up to 200g of coconut cream to the mix before blending – for a sensational infusion of coconut.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Cauliflower-Sauce1-400x216.jpg,6,231

540,"Chickpea, potato & quinoa burgers","1 small onion, I prefer red onions but any will do
1-2 cloves of garlic, crushed
1-2 chillies, chopped (if you don’t want them spicy, you can leave these out)
1 can of chickpeas, washed and drained
1 can of chopped tomatoes
1-2 teaspoons of vegetable stock powder
3-4 teaspoons of spices (I used turmeric, cumin, garam masala
2 large potatoes, boiled & mashed
100g of quinoa
250ml of water
Gram (chickpea) flour (ordinary flour will do if you don’t have any)
Vegetable oil","Sauté off the onions, chillies, and garlic in a glug of the oil.
Add 3 teaspoons of the spices to the mixture and mix well.
Add the chickpeas, chopped tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of vegetable stock powder.
Allow the mixture to simmer for a while until the chickpeas have softened enough to eat then remove from the heat.
In the meantime, cook the quinoa in a rice cooker or flat-bottomed pan with the 250ml of water, remaining vegetable stock, and spices.
Once all the ingredients are cooled, add them to a food processor and blend. You may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your food processor. If you do, try to make sure there’s an equal amount of each ingredient in each batch.
Once the mixture has blended, add the flour, a tablespoon at a time and mix, keep going until you reach a consistency that is still fairly moist but firm enough that it will hold its shape when shaped and handled gently.
With some of the flour in a bowl, and begin making the mixture into balls and coating them in the flour before squashing them into burger patty shapes. How big is up to you – judge it based on the size you want.
Heat up about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a wok, to test the temperature is right, drop a small amount of mixture into the pan and if it bubbles, it’s ready to cook the burgers.
Cook the burgers for 5-10 minutes, until a lovely golden brown colour, then transfer them to a plate with some kitchen roll to drain the excess oil.
Serve in burger buns with whatever garnish you fancy and some yummy potato wedges or chips. I love them with red onions, grated courgette and chilli jam. Mmmmmm!",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Chickpea-potato-quinoa-burger-400x267.jpg,3,420

260g plain white flour
2 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp fine sea salt
55g vegan butter, at room temperature
100g granulated sugar
50g light muscovado sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp lemon zest
240ml vegan soy yoghurt, unsweetened and unflavoured
200g blueberries (fresh or frozen)
","Preheat the oven to 190c. Grease a 20x26cm baking dish or cake tin.To Make the CrumblePlace all the crumble ingredients in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter or two knives, chop everything together until you have a lumpy, crumbly texture. If you like your crumble much finer, rub the mixture between your fingertips to break up the lumps of butter. Set aside.To Make the CakeIn a small bowl mix together the psyllium husks and water. If using ground flax/linseeds instead, use 1 tablespoon of seeds and 2 tablespoons of water instead.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and fine sea salt. Whisk well to combine. Set aside.
In a separate medium bowl, place the vegan butter. Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, beat the butter for a minute or until smooth and light. Add the thickened psyllium husks, sugars, vanilla, and lemon zest and beat again to combine. Note that psyllium husks like to clump together, so be sure to beat until smooth.
Alternating between the soy yoghurt and the flour mixture, add a few spoonfuls at a time, beating to combine between each addition. Once fully combined, add the soy milk and beat for a final time. You should now have a thick cake batter.
Add ¾ of the blueberries and very gently fold them into the batter. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray or cake tin and spread smooth with the back of a spoon. Top with the remaining blueberries.
Finally, top the cake with the crumble topping and place in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until puffed in the centre and the crumble is browned nicely.
Remove once baked and allow to cool fully on a wire cooling rack before slicing and serving.For tips on baking without eggs and dairy, check out our vegan baking guide.

1 ½ tablespoons of chili powder
½ tablespoon of cumin
1 cup of canned 100% pure pumpkin
2 cans of your favourite beans (pinto, black, kidney), drained
1 ½ – 2 cups of vegetable broth
1 small can of tomato paste
1 can of corn
1-2 spring onions (chopped; optional garnish)
Vegan sour cream","First, place a tablespoon of oil into a large pot and a sprinkle of salt; this will prevent sticking. Then, toss in the onion and garlic and cook on medium heat until the onions have softened (approximately 8-10 minutes). Whilst the onions and garlic are softening, cook the quinoa as per the instructions on the packet and set aside for later.
Once the onions have softened and the garlic is fragrant, cover them with the chili powder and cumin and stir in and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes until all of the moisture in the pot has evaporated (if you prefer adding more cumin/chili powder you can do so to your own taste). At this point stir in the tomato paste, broth and carrots, and simmer for 5-6 minutes to amalgamate the flavors.
Once the mixture has been brought to a simmer, stir in the pumpkin, then the beans and bring the chili to a boil. Once at a boil, reduce the heat and stir the beans until covered and cook them until cooked through (10-15 minutes). Once cooked, add the corn and quinoa to the chili last minute to heat through.
Serve immediately with a small dollop of your favorite vegan sour cream and a few chopped pieces of spring onion.By Allison Bailey

551,Vegan Sausage and Mash,"1 x pack of vegan sausages (I chose Dee’s Leek and Onion as they’re lush!)
Enough potatoes to make your own mountain of mash
Broccoli
Veggie gravy (see link in Preparation for recipe)
Salt and cracked pepper
Vegan spread/marge","Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image:split-pin.co.ukYou can use gravy granules or make your own. I always make my own and you can find out howin my Vegan Roast Dinner recipe.If making your own gravy, you probably want to get started on that first. If using granules you can start on that about the same time as the broccoli
Wash and chop your potatoes (I always leave the skins on, even for mash, as there’s so much goodness there!), and add to a pan of water
Bring to boil and then keep on a medium heat until the potatoes are nice and soft
In the meantime, cook the sausages according to the instructions on the packet
Wash and cut your broccoli into florets and add to a pan of hot water. I like my broccoli crunchy and bright green so I only cook mine in boiling water for a few minutes before draining and serving
Drain your potatoes and mash with a little vegan marge, a little salt and heaps of cracked pepper

552,Banana Breakfast Muffins,"5.2 oz (150g, 80ml) melted coconut oil (can also use vegetable/sunflower or other mild oils)
1tsp vanilla extract
1 1/4 cup (5.7oz, 150g) wholewheat flour
3/4 cup (3.5 oz, 100g) self-raising flour
1tsp baking powder
½ cup (3.5oz, 100g) granulated sugar
1/2 cup (100ml) of your preferred plant-based milk
2 flax “eggs” (2tbsp ground flax mixed with 6tbsp water)
3 ripe medium bananas","Pre-heat the oven to 350f / 185c / Gas Mark 5
Mix up the two flax “eggs” by adding the ground flax to the water and set to one side.
Combine the wholewheat flour, self-raising flour, baking powder and granulated sugar in a bowl.
Mash the bananas and to this add your plant-based milk of choice oil, vanilla and two flax “eggs”. Stir well to combine all of the ingredients.
Make a well in the centre of your dry ingredients, add the wet and mix together until they are just to say combined. Don’t over-mix as you will rid the batter of air and give it less of a rise when baking.
Spoon your mixture into the muffin cases and bake for 18-22 minutes.
Before putting them into the oven, you might like to sprinkle a little more ground flax over the top but it’s not essential.
You will know they’re done when you insert a toothpick and it comes out dry. Once there is no batter on the toothpick, remove from the oven as over-baking will lead to dried out muffins.
These will keep for 3-4 days in an airtight container or you can individually freeze them once completely cooled. Individual freezing is a great method for those who struggle to make time for breakfast as you can take one out of the freezer and place it into the fridge the day before and it’s ready to grab the next morning.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Banana-Breakfast-Muffins-2-400x533.jpg,9,365
553,Homemade Vegan Gravy,"Splash of olive oil 
2 large carrots, diced
2 sticks of celery, diced
1 medium red onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, crushed or minced
1 teaspoon of dried thyme
1 tablespoon of maple syrup, agave, or sugar
2-3 teaspoons of yeast extract – add according to your preference
2 tablespoons of plain flour (if you have an allergy, corn flour, gram flour or your preferred flour for thickening will do)
3 tablespoons of red wine (or you can use 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar)
2 teaspoons of vegetable bouillon powder
2 teaspoons of tomato paste or puree (or ketchup in a pinch)
900ml of cold water","Serves 4Heat the oil in a large flat-bottomed pan, then add the celery, onion, and carrots
Once the veg has started to soften, add the garlic, turning the heat to medium
Once the garlic is beginning to cook, but before it goes brown, add the maple syrup/sugar and stir, ensuring all ingredients are well coated
Allow to simmer for a minute or so, until the vegetables begin to caramelise
Add the yeast extract and mix again to ensure even coating
If at any point you find the pan is browning, add a small splash of water to prevent burning
Add the flour & vegetable bouillon, stir to make sure everything is coated evenly
Add the wine or balsamic vinegar and mix well
Once the wine/vinegar has heated up, add the water, stirring continually as you do
Bring to the boil, stirring regularly
Stir in the tomato puree
Allow to simmer for 15 minutes or so, until the mixture thickens and the gravy reduces to your desired consistency
Once you’ve achieved your desired consistency and flavour, sieve into a fresh pan and warm just before you serve the remainder of your mealTips:If you don’t have yeast extract, you can try substituting with nutritional yeast and/or soy sauce
For a bit of variety, try adding different herbs, such as sage, or bay leaves
Try adding mushrooms or a little chopped beetroot when you’re adding the veg for a slightly more earthy flavour, the beetroot also gives the gravy a lovely deep colour to it
If you want to get all the flavour when sieving, feel free to pour a little freshly boiled water over the remaining mixture, then reduce down as needed",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gravy-small-sizewm-400x267.jpg,3,355

Put the water, amaretto, cinnamon stick, star anise and pears in a saucepan with a lid. Boil for 8-15 minutes until the pears are cooked through. Test this by using a sharp knife rather than a fork which will leave an unsightly mark on the pears.
Mix the cream cheese with the vanilla seeds.
To serve, plate the chocolate nut crumb first, add a pear to each plate and spoonful of vanilla cream cheese on the side and drizzle the hot amaretto water on the pear.TIPS
Cut the bottom of the pears flat so they will stay upright when plated.
If you want to increase the sweetness in the dish you can serve it with a small pot of maple syrup.

566,Chocolate and Hazelnut Swiss Roll,"For the sponge:
150g Aquafaba
¼ tsp cream of tartar
90ml plant milk (I use soya)
1tbs apple cider vinegar
160g Plain flour
190g caster sugar
40g cocoa powder
½ tsp salt
½ tsp baking powder
¼ tsp baking soda
75ml vegetable oil
Icing sugar for dusting
For the whipped ganache filling:
100g Rhythm 108 vegan hazelnut truffle bar
75ml vegan pouring cream
","1. Preheat the oven to 180c fan. Grease and line a baking tray (roughly 33 x 25cm) with parchment paper.
2. Pour the aquafaba and the cream of tartar into the bowl of a stand mixer and mix on medium high speed until stiff peaks are formed. This means the aquafaba doesn’t move even when tipped upside down.
3. Meanwhile, place the plant milk into the microwave for 1 minute to warm through, this can also be done in a pan over a medium heat on the hob. Add in the apple cider vinegar and stir, place to the side.
4. In a large mixing bowl, add the plain flour, caster sugar, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Mix with a whisk until fully combined.
5. Add the oil and the milk/apple cider vinegar mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until fully combined. The mixture will be very stiff and dry at this point but that’s normal.
6. Gently fold the aquafaba into the mixture one spoon at a time, trying not to knock too much air out. It will become a much looser mixture as you add more aquafaba.
7. Pour the mixture into the lined baking tray, and level out the top until smooth.
8. Place in the oven for 12-15mins, until a skewer comes out clean. Whilst the sponge is baking, lay out a piece of parchment paper the size of the sponge and cover with a light sprinkle of caster sugar.
9. Once the sponge is fully baked, tip it out top side down onto the parchment covered in sugar. Peel off the parchment paper on the bottom of the sponge.
10. Use a sharp knife to make an incision an inch into the short side of the sponge, being carefully to only cut half way into the sponge and not the full way through (this just makes it easier to roll).
11. Carefully roll up the sponge with the parchment still inside (this stops it from sticking together) and leave to cool rolled up.
12. Meanwhile, for the filling, warm the cream until it is steaming (either 1-2minutes in the microwave or over a medium heat on the hob). Once the cream is steaming hot, break up your Rhythm 108 hazelnut truffle bar into chunks and place into the cream. Leave to stand for 1 minute, then stir until a glossy mixture is formed, with no lumps of chocolate.
13. Place this in the fridge to set. Once the ganache has hardened, place into a large mixing bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer and whip up on medium high until you get a light and fluffy filling.
14. Once the sponge is cool, unroll carefully, then fill with the whipped ganache, spreading out evenly over the sponge.
15. Gently roll back up to form your perfect swiss roll! Don’t panic if there are a few cracks…it looks just as perfect. You can finish by cutting off the edges and dusting lightly with icing sugar!

Allow the weight of the pan to press them gently and apply gentle pressure using a tea towel once softened (you want them to soften, before properly pressing them, otherwise they break). As soon as you start to see water being released, start to apply more pressure. Turn and press on the other side, until they are half the size of the raw mushroom. (The whole pressing process will take between 8-10 minutes). Repeat for remaining mushrooms until caramelized on edges.
Combine all spices and seasonings in a small bowl and coat the stem side of the mushroom with the blend. Flip over and repeat, coating with the spices. Use a spoon to push the seasoning into the surface of the mushrooms.
Heat up a pan on medium heat and coat surface liberally with vegan butter. Saute mushrooms in a pan and blacken on both sides.
Make Tzatziki; Mix plain yoghurt, mint, garlic clove (crushed and finely chopped), lemon zest, and salt in a bowl.
Prep your side vegetables, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and fresh parsley
Remove mushrooms from the pan and chop into thin slices, reminiscent of kebab meat.
Warm pitta bread in the oven and wrap in a tea towel, assemble your shawarma on a plate, topped with Tzatziki, arugula, mushrooms, tomatoes, sliced cucumber, parsley, and harissa.

575,Buddha Bowl,"Cooked rice/quinoa
Sweet potato
Broccoli
Kale
Beans – black or black-eyed are good!
Carrots
Garlic
Olive and sesame oil
Spices! Smoked paprika, turmeric, salt, pepper
The juice of one lemon
Soy and hot sauce","Top tip!If you don’t already own it then you must go and buy Isa Does It by Isa Chandra Moskowitz, as she has an entire section on bowl food and every recipe is just wonderful. And quick! Her recipes have literally changed my life.
I haven’t included amounts here as you’re basically making to serve, so enough kale for however many people etc. etc.Cut up your sweet potato into small chunks and coat with a little olive oil, smoked paprika, turmeric, salt and pepper. Roast for about 30 minutes.
Add 1 cup of rice to cold water, bring to boil, turn down and simmer for 30 minutes. If you want to add extra protein then use quinoa instead of rice.
That’s the most complicated part of the cooking done!
Prepare your veg…
Crush and dice your garlic.
Chop up your broccoli into florets.
Grate your carrot.
Wash your kale and beans.
When it looks like the rice and sweet potato is about 10 minutes off being ready, start cooking the veg!
Put the broccoli in a pan with cold water and on a medium high heat with the lid on. You want to cook your broc until the water is just boiling and then tip out into a colander. Crunchy broccoli is where it’s at!
Add the garlic to a heavy bottom pan with a little oil (only a touch) and get it sizzling. After about 1 minute add your kale.
Once the kale is wilting slightly, add the carrot and then the beans. Mix up well.
Squeeze over the juice of one lemon and add a dash of sesame oil and the soy sauce. Mix well.
Once the beans are warmed through you’re ready to serve. Your broccoli should be bubbling by now too, or thereabouts.
Take out the sweet potato from the oven and get the hummus out of the fridge (I make my own).
Now bowl up… Add a good serving spoon of rice per bowl, and then dish the veg around it. Finish with a big dollop of hummus on the top!
Season with pepper and hot sauce, and take the hummus and soy with you to the table in case you want to add extra flavour.

576,Roast Butternut Squash and Spinach Salad,"1 butternut squash
Smoked paprika
1 bag of spinach
Cherry tomatoes
Kalamata olives
Cucumber
Celery
1 red pepper
Sunflower seeds
Extra virgin olive oil
Balsamic vinegar
Salt and cracked pepper","Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image:split-pin.co.ukCut your butternut squash into 2/3cm chunks and pour into a roasting tin.
Add a small glug of olive oil, smoked paprika, a little salt and cracked pepper. Mix well.
Put into the oven at 220C for about 30 minutes (cook until soft and slightly caramelised).
In the meantime make your salad… Wash and cut your veg (no need to cut up the spinach unless you have really large leaves, then it is better to tear rather than use a knife) and add to the bowl.
Add all the smaller veggies first and then mix in handfuls of the spinach leaves at a time, so everything is evenly mixed.
Into a fry pan, pour out some sunflower seeds. More is more here, so don’t scrimp. You want at least half a cup of seeds.
Dry fry the seeds on a medium heat until they are turning golden on both sides, stir a lot with a wooden or heat resistant spoon. Take care not to let them burn. Set aside to cool.
When the squash is ready, remove from oven and allow to cool for a minute or so, before spooning on top of the salad mix.
Then add the toasted seeds.
Shake some olive oil over the top, about the same and a half of balsamic vinegar and some cracked pepper.
Mix slightly, but make sure the squash and seeds are still visible on the top.

577,Banana and Coconut Cake,"For the cake:250g / 9 oz plain flour (wheat, spelt or gluten-free)
3 level teaspoons baking powder
100g / 3½ oz fairtrade light brown or golden sugar
75g / 2½ oz desiccated coconut
4 medium to large over-ripe fairtrade bananas
150ml / 5.1 fl oz plant milk of your choice, e.g. soya, rice or oat milk
100ml / 3.4 fl oz / sunflower oil
1 tablespoon golden syrup or rice syrup
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extractFor the topping:200g / 7 oz creamed coconut (1 block)
200ml / 6.8 fl oz canned coconut milk
1 tablespoon agave nectar
50g / 2 oz desiccated coconut","Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4 and grease an 8” round cake tin.
Sieve together the flour, baking powder and sugar. Gently stir in the desiccated coconut.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the plant milk, sunflower oil, syrup and vanilla extract.
Peel and chop the bananas then mash well until there are no lumps remaining or purée them in a blender. Whisk the liquid mixture into the banana purée.
Make a well in the bowl of dry ingredients and fold in the wet banana mixture a little at a time.
Pour into the prepared cake tin and bake in the pre-heated oven for about 45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cover the cake with foil if it begins to brown too much during baking.
Remove from the oven and leave in the tin to set for 10-15 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
To make the topping, chop the block of creamed coconut into small pieces. Melt it in a double boiler by placing a bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn’t touch the water.
Meanwhile, pour the coconut milk into a large bowl and whisk well until smooth or use a blender. If you’re using a 400ml can, whisk or blend the coconut milk before measuring out your 200ml. Stir in the agave nectar and desiccated coconut, then whisk in the melted coconut cream.
Put the topping in the fridge to set a little until it becomes stiff enough to spread on top of the cooled cake.
Decorate with slices of firm banana, which have been brushed with lemon juice to prevent them browning, and toasted coconut shreds or chopped nuts.

2.5 tablespoons of melted coconut oil 
3/4 teaspoons of sea salt
1/4 cup salted peanut butter 
1 heaped cup vegan chocolate chips (or other vegan chocolate)","This recipe makes about 16 Truffles – this will vary according to the size of the Truffles made. Put the dates and 1 tablespoon of melted coconut oil in the blender and mix. If it’s not quite combining, drizzle in warm water a little at a time (about 1 teaspoon), scrape down sides and blend until a rough paste or ball forms – if you add too much water it will be difficult to handle them later as they won’t freeze up well
Add the sea salt and blend again, then freeze for 10 – 15 minutes
Create small balls of the mix in your hands. Put them on a baking tray which has been lined with greaseproof paper and put them back in the freezer while you do the next step
Put the peanut butter and 1/2 a tablespoon of coconut oil in a bowl or pan and melt it on the cooker or in a microwave
Drizzle the warmed peanut butter on the truffles and freeze for about 10 – 15 minutes
Put the chocolate chips and remaining 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in a pan or bowl and melt it
Remove truffles from freezer and, use a fork to scoop truffles in to the pan/bowl, so that it’s coated in chocolate, then hold it above the pan/bowl to ensure that any excess drips off, before putting it on the greaseproof paper again
Put them back in freezer to set, the dust them with cocoa powder to serveServing:Serve the truffles straight from the freezer, but if they’ve been in the freezer for a day or longer, take out the number that you are going eat and allow them to soften for about 10 – 15 minutes, before biting into them.
Storage: They can be stored in the freezer for at least 2 weeks.
Optional:Sprinkle a small amount of sea salt on the truffles before freezing them for the final time
Variations: The next time I made these I put them in disposable cupcake cases, which was easier and neater. I’ve now purchased reusable cupcake cases to do this in the future.

¼tsp stevia syrup (optional)
Small amount of desiccated coconut or grated dark chocolate to sprinkle on top (optional)","Serves 8.
Preheat the oven to 180C.In a large mixing bowl, cream the margarine and sugar. Once mixed, stir in the flax eggs followed by the beetroot purée and coffee.In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa and baking powder. Using a sieve to remove any lumps, slowly add the flour mix to the beetroot mix, a small amount at a time. As you go, gently fold in the flour, avoiding stirring too much. Finally, stir in the chopped chocolate.Grease a deep tin or oven-proof dish (glass or ceramic are fine) and pour the mixture in, spreading evenly. Place in the oven and bake for around 45 minutes; the exact cooking time will depend on your oven. For fudgy brownies, you can tell they are cooked when the edges begin to pull away from the container and putting a cocktail stick in doesn’t bring out any lumps (it won’t come out clean for fudgy ones even when they are cooked).Once the brownies are cooked, remove from the oven. Leave for around five minutes to cool slightly before transferring to a cooling rack or kitchen paper. Allow them to cool completely before adding the topping.Whilst the brownies are cooling, bring a small amount of water to the boil in a large pan. Place a large heat-proof mixing bowl over the pan and add the chocolate, coconut oil, and beetroot water into the bowl. Stir constantly until the ingredients have melted and formed a smooth, glossy paste. Mix in the stevia syrup, if using.Spread the topping evenly over each brownie and sprinkle with either desiccated coconut or grated chocolate. Serve as warm or cold!Like this recipe?

593,Pear and Coconut Crumble,"4-6 large, ripe pears
6 tbsp coconut oil (or margarine)
10 tbsp coconut sugar (or other unrefined sugar) or maple syrup
Juice of half a lemon 
2 cups coconut cream
Dusting of ground ginger
Crumble:
1/3 cup solid coconut oil (or margarine, but coconut is better)
½ cup coconut sugar (or other unrefined sugar)
2 cups jumbo oats
1/3 cup desiccated coconut
½ cup 80% dark chocolate, broken into pieces (ginger chocolate is especially good!)","Preheat the oven to 350F/180C. Peel the pears, cut in half, and remove the stalks and seeds. Drizzle with lemon juice to stop browning.
Melt coconut oil (or margarine) in a pan, and add the pear halves. Add the sugar, and allow to caramelise.
After about fifteen minutes, add the coconut cream. Place the contents into a casserole dish. It will look like there’s too much liquid, but don’t worry, as it will be absorbed by the crumble.
Make the crumble: I prefer not to use flour in my crumble as I’m gluten free, but if you’d like it, use about 80g flour, and half the amount of oats. Rub the oil or margarine into the oats. Add the sugar and desiccated coconut. Add the pieces of chocolate and mix well. Place the mixture onto the top of the pears. Bake for 45 minutes.
Serve with soya cream or soya ice cream.

1/4 tsp Peppercorns
1/2 tsp Salt
1 tsp Chopped or dried herbs such as sage or thyme
3 tbsp Mushroom Ketchup (optional)
1 tbsp Lemon juice
Flax Seed Crackers:
300g Flax seeds (you can used half golden and half brown if you have them)
30g Sunflower Seeds
200ml Water
1/2 tsp Salt
A small bunch of cavolo nero","Individually these recipes are pretty simple and easy but it is a bit of work making them all. However, I find there’s plenty of time around Christmas to spend a few hours in the kitchen and these recipes will make enough to keep you and your family going over the festive period.
The flax seed crackers recipe makes about 30 crackers, 15 plain and 15 flavoured. I used cavolo nero but you can use any leafy greens or even sun-dried tomatoes, or whatever you fancy to flavour them.
Cashew Nut CheesePlace the cashews in a glass bowl and cover with water, leave them to soak for at least 2 hours or leave them overnight.
Drain the cashews, blend them with 250ml water, the nutritional yeast, salt and lemon juice. If your nutritional yeast flakes are quite large you might want to put them in the blender first to break them down so they are nice and small. Keep blending the mix until you get a nice creamy paste.
Stir in the onion granules and nutmeg.
Pour the mixture into a tin or bowl and leave it at room temperature, covered for 12 hours.
Put the mixture into the fridge and leave to chill for at least 2 hours.Mushroom and ChestnutPâtéCut a cross in the shell of each chestnut and roast them on a baking tray for 30 minutes at 170C.
Place your block of tofu on a flat surface between two folded sheets of kitchen paper and place something heavy on top to press out the water.
Whilst the chestnuts are roasting, sauté the onion and garlic in a large frying pan until soft. Roughly chop the mushrooms and add them to the pan, cooking them for 10-15 minutes until all the liquid has evaporated.
Stir in the crushed peppercorns, salt, herbs and mushroom ketchup. Cook for another few minutes until the ketchup has reduced down, then set aside to cool.
Once the chestnuts are roasted, take them out of the oven and leave them to cool before shelling them.
Put the chestnuts into a blender and blitz until roughly chopped. Add the cooled mushroom mixture, tofu, nutritional yeast and lemon juice. Blend to a fairly smooth paste.
Spoon the mixture into a springform tin or lined loaf tin and press down firmly. Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.Flax Seed CrackersGrind half the flax seeds with the sunflower seeds in a blender or spice grinder.
Mix together the ground seeds with the whole flax seeds, salt and water.
Put half this mixture into a blender with the cavolo nero.
Line two baking trays with baking paper and spoon out the two mixtures on the trays and press down firmly with the back of a spoon.
Score the mixture into small squares and bake at 170C for 30 mins or until the begin to crisp slightly and aren’t too chewy inside. (If you have a dehydrator, even better!)
Lift the baking paper and crackers out of the trays and place on a wire rack, serve once cooled.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Cheese-pate-crackers-400x296.jpg,12,487

605,Vegan Fish Fingers,"Step 1 ingredients:
Plenty of cooking oil
Sushi sheets
Step 2 ingredients:
250g extra firm tofu
150g artichoke hearts in oil
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Step 3 ingredients:
80g chickpea flour
5 tbsp nutritional yeast
(2 tbsp olive oil)
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
Step 4 ingredients:
Breadcrumbs (e.g. gluten-free ones)
Optional ingredients:
Lemons
Peas
Ketchup
vegan Mayo
Potatoes salad
Chips","Step 1:
Pour cooking oil into a pan and add 1 pack of sushi nori sheets to infuse the oil. The longer you leave them in the better: e.g. you could soak them in the morning and then cook the vegan fish fingers in the evening for a more intense taste. Alternatively, if you don’t have much time heat them up a bit for 5 minutes so they give up more flavour. Make sure the heat isn’t too high because they burn easily.
Step 2:
Place ingredients of step 2 into a food processor until you get a semi-smooth mixture.
Step 3:
Transfer the mixture into a large bowl and add all other ingredients from this step and mix. Make sure there are no chickpea flour lumps, otherwise the fish fingers might taste bitter.
Form fish finger shapes. Alternatively, just form sausage shapes. Admittedly it was a bit of work to make rectangular shapes and when they were fried they lost their shape a bit anyway. So if you want to make your life easier, roll them into a sausage shape, it won’t make a difference in terms of taste. They will be quite soft at this stage, but don’ worry they will firm up when fried.
Step 4:
Add breadcrumbs to a bowl and roll the vegan fish fingers in them until they are covered on all sides.
Take the sushi sheets out of the pan with cooking oil and heat up the pan. Fry the fish fingers in the pan until they are golden brown. Place on a kitchen towel to soak up the excess oil.
Optionally drizzle some lemon juice on top when serving the fish fingers. Have cooked peas, chips or potato salad and ketchup or vegan mayo on the side. Enjoy!

Spoon in half the pie filling then add the dried cranberries evenly on top, finish with the rest of the mixture, pressing down.
Roll out the pastry lid, place on top and fold the pastry from the sides on to pie lid, crimp together. (There should be an inch wall for the cranberries to sit in)Make a slit in the middle of the pie to let steam out. Brush with any plant milk.
Place in the oven for 40 mins.
Now mix the frozen cranberries with the maple syrup and place on top of pie, cook for 5 minutes, the cranberries can burn easily so keep an eye on them 😊
Let pie cool slightly before removing from the tin.

Olive oil
Cracked black pepper
Cracked sea salt
Optional:
Roasted chickpeas
Spring onion

Chop up the pepper into bite sized squares
Quarter your tomatoes
Squash each olive with the back of your knife to pop out the stone, rip in half
Pour kale onto board with rest of veg and assess the frying gnocchi – if the gnocchi is starting to turn a light gold colour, turn down the heat and fill the kettle up with water
Pour boiling water into a saucepan, on a medium/high heat and throw in the remaining gnocchi
When each of the gnocchi have floated to the surface (after a couple of minutes) turn down the heat and pour into the colander to drain
In the same pan, on a low heat, put a generous dollop of pesto
Add the peppers, tomatoes and olives and mix together
Check that your fried gnocchi is nearly done – you want it golden in colour, with a crunchy outside and a soft middle. Try if you are unsure
Add the boiled gnocchi to your pesto mix and then add the kale, stirring as you go
When the kale is starting to wilt and darken in colour, turn off the heat on both pans
Serves immediately onto warmed plates, with the pesto-covered gnocchi in the centre and some crunchy fried gnocchi round the edges

624,Mixed Root Vegetable Gnocchi in Sage-Pistachio Pesto,"For the pesto:
2 shallots, minced
10 leaves of fresh sage, minced
1 tbsp coconut oil
1/8 tsp cinnamon
2 1/2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp fresh parsley
1 tbsp tahini
1 cup shelled pistachios
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
Olive oil to thin, as needed
For the gnocchi:
1/2 of a butternut squash, seeded
2 large beets, peeled
1 medium sweet potato, peeled
1 medium celeriac, peeled
1 large parsnip, peeled
1 medium turnip, peeled
4-6 cups brown rice flour, divided, plus more for dusting","Combining quintessential autumnal flavors—sage, maple syrup, cinnamon—with an array of multi-colored root vegetables, this perfect fall entrée is sophisticated comfort food at its finest. While the combination of root vegetables produces an aesthetically striking dish, it does complicate the process a bit. If you’d like to make the recipe simpler, simply use one root vegetable instead of all six.
Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Wrap the beets, sweet potato, celeriac, parsnip, and turnip each individually in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Place the butternut squash, face-down, on the baking sheet, as well. Roast all of the veggies for 45-60 minutes until you can pierce through them with a fork. Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.
Meanwhile, make the pesto. Heat the coconut oil over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the shallots and sage. Sauté for 5-10 minutes, or until golden brown. Add the sauté to a food processor along with the rest of the pesto ingredients, except for the olive oil. Pulse until well combined, scraping down the sides as necessary. As the motor is running, drizzle in olive oil to achieve the desired consistency.
Set a large pot of salted water to boil.
Once the veggies have cooled, puree each of them separately in a food processor(or mash them separately with a potato masher) and place the purees into separate bowls. Make sure that you process the beets last so as not to stain the other veggie purees with a magenta hue. Combine the purees of celeriac, turnip, and parsnip. You’ll have four bowls of puree in front of you: one deep orange(butternut squash), one light orange(sweet potato), one magenta(beet), and one white(celeriac, turnip, and parsnip). Combine each of the purees with 1 cup of brown rice flour, adding more to each bowl to achieve an ever-so-slightly sticky consistency(the butternut squash and sweet potato purees will require less than the others).
Dust a work surface with additional flour. Divide each dough into two portions and roll them into snakes about 1/2-inch in width. Cut each snake into 10-20 gnocchi and place in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Once the pot of water is boiling, drop the gnocchi—ten at a time and only with gnocchi of like color—into the pot. Cook until the gnocchi floats to the top, about 30 seconds. Remove the gnocchi from the water and place in a colander sitting over a bowl to allow the water to drain.
Combine all of the gnocchi in a large bowl(at this point, the boiling will have sealed their color, so it’s safe to combine them). Add the pesto and stir well to coat. Serve warm.

1 tsp Vanilla Extract tsp
1,000 g Icing Sugar
30 g Cocoa Powder
250 g Vegan Butter
2 tbs Soya Milk
125 g Black cherry jam
","1. For the swiss roll. Preheat your oven to 160ºC Fan/Gas 3. Line a shallow baking tray approximately 30cm x 20cm with greaseproof paper.
2. Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then add the cornflour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt and sugar and stir together.
3. Pour the milk, vinegar, oil and vanilla extract into a jug and whisk until combined.
4. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir well with a light hand, be careful not to overwork the batter then pour into the prepared baking tray and bake in the oven for approximately 25 minutes until cooked through and a skewer comes out clean.
5. Meanwhile for the buttercream. Add the icing sugar, cocoa powder and the butter into a food processor and blitz together. Add the soya milk, a little at a time until the buttercream starts to combine and is smooth. You want a medium to firm texture. Split into two bowls.
6. Once the cake is cooked. Leave to cool for around 5 minutes and then carefully roll into a swiss roll shape, keeping the greaseproof paper on. When cooled after around half an hour, gently unroll the log and spread with black cherry jam followed by half of the buttercream. Once again carefully re-roll the cake this time carefully removing the greaseproof paper as you roll. Once rolled, place the log on a piece of clingfilm and roll tightly and place in the fridge to chill until needed, you could actually freeze the cake at this stage for half an hour.
7. To assemble. Remove the cling film from the swiss roll and cover the outer swiss roll with the remaining buttercream. We use a piping bag for this and pipe lines down sides of the roll then use a fork to create a textured log effect.
8. Sprinkle with icing sugar and serve.
NOTES
1. You could use holly, sprinkles or vegan edible decorations for garnish, Christmas is the occasion to go all out with your decorating.
2. For ease you could just use jam inside the yuletide log and buttercream the outside only.

Finely chop one onion and a couple of cloves of garlic. Add to a frying pan with a little olive oil.
Add half a teaspoon (each) of oregano, basil and thyme and mix.
Add a can of chopped tomatoes, a little salt and cracked pepper and leave to simmer and thicken. If you don’t let the sauce thicken enough, your toppings can all slide off when eating. So this is why you need a little time to make the sauce. You don’t want it in any way watery.
Assemble your pizza:Make tomato sauce or use a base with sauce already added.
Preheat your oven to 220C.
Wash some kale and add it to a frying pan with a little olive oil. Sauté for a few minutes until the kale is dark green. Turn off heat.
Chop the rest of your ingredients and grate the cheese.

3 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped
¼ tsp vanilla extract
1 14-oz can full-fat coconut milk
½ cup non-dairy milk","Since I do not own an ice cream maker, nor, I’m sure, do many of you, I’ve offered instructions for two methods of making this ice cream with no more appliances than a freezer, a spoon, and maybe a food processor.
Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and puree until very smooth.
Ice Cream Machine Method: 
Pour the pureed mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the maker’s instructions. Transfer to a container and store in the freezer.
Non-Ice Cream Machine Methods: 
Pour the pureed mixture into a large Tupperware container, a deep baking dish, or a stainless steel bowl andplace inside the freezer. After 45 minutes, remove the mixture from the freezer andstirit vigorously with a spatula or whisk, breaking up any frozen sections. Return the mixture to the freezer, stirring vigorously every 30 minutes for about 2-3 hours, or until the mixture is completely frozen. Store in the freezer. With this method, you’ll have to thaw the ice cream for at least 10 minutes before serving.
An alternative non-ice cream machine method is to pour the pureed mixture into an ice cube tray and freeze completely. When you’d like to enjoy a bowl of ice cream, pop a couple of the frozen cubes out of the tray and blend in a food processor until creamy.

646,Roast Veg Pizza on a Cauliflower Base,"PIZZA CRUST BASE
400g cauliflower (approx. half a large head of cauliflower or one small one)
15g ground chia seeds
25g Pulsin Soya Protein Powder
50g ground almonds
40g nutritional yeast
Chia egg substitute: 2 tbsp milled chia mixed with 5 tbsp water (equivalent to 2 eggs)
1 tbsp dried mixed herbs
Salt and pepper
TOMATO SAUCE TOPPING
1 tbsp ground flaxseed (this is optional but it helps thicken the sauce and adds omega-3s and fibre!)
1 1/2 tbsp sugar-free apple sauce
5 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp tamari
1.5 tbsp dried oregano
Salt and pepper
2 garlic cloves, crushed
TOPPINGS: The fun bit!
Of course, you can add what toppings you like here. I have topped mine with roasted vegetables: sliced beetroot, cubes of roasted sweet potato, red onion chunks, red pepper chunks-roasted with a little rapeseed oil for 30-40 mins.
For 2 medium pizzas you will need:
1 large beetroot, peeled & sliced
2 red onions
1 1/2 red pepper
1 medium sweet potato
100g Basil pesto tofu (available in supermarkets), sliced
3-4 tbsp nutritional yeast","Remove the leaves from the cauliflower and cut into chunks. Then using a blender or food processor, blitz the cauliflower until it is finely chopped so that it resembles rice, i.e. cauliflower crumbTransfer the crumb into a steamer and steam for 15 mins or microwave in a bowl with cling-film (with a hole or two on top) for 6 mins until softPreheat the oven to 200ºC (180ºC fan). Line 2 large baking sheets with greaseproof paper and a little coconut spray oilAllow the cooked cauliflower crumb to cool before transferring into a clean tea towel and squeezing as much moisture as you can out. (Really wring it!) You may need more than one tea towelTransfer the dehydrated cauliflower crumb into a bowl and add the remaining pizza base ingredients: ground chia seeds, protein powder (I used Pulsin Soya Protein powder), ground almonds, nutritional yeast, chia egg substitute, dried mixed herbs, a large pinch of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepperUsing your hands, divide the pizza mixture in half and place directly on each baking sheet. Shape into a ball and then press down to form a round pizza base shapeBake for 15 mins until the bases are golden brown and starting to crisp a little at the edges. If you want your base extra crispy, half-way through baking, flip it over to ensure both sides are well bakedWhilst the base is baking, mix together the ground flaxseed, sugar-free apple sauce, tomato purée, tamari, dried oregano, garlic and season with salt and pepperSpread the tomato topping onto each of the pizza basesThen top your pizza with your topping of choice. I Have chosen roasted vegetables and slices of basil pesto tofu. Sprinkle over with nutritional yeastTurn the oven up to 240ºC (220ºC fan) and bake for a further 12- 15 minsI love to serve mine with a large handful of fresh rocket on top and a side salad. Enjoy!The key to making a great cauliflower crust pizza is by making a cauliflower crumb and then dehydrating it, so that as much moisture is squeezed out as possible, allowing the remaining crumb to be turned into a crispy pizza base. (If you don’t squeeze out the moisture, the base will be all soggy). You will be surprised with the amount of liquid which comes out! But this delicious grain-free pizza is well worth the effort.
There are two ways you can dehydrate your cauliflower crumb: the more time-consuming method is by putting the cooked cauliflower crumb in a tea-towel or two and wringing out the moisture. (I think of this as stress relief!). Alternatively, if you are lucky enough to have a juicer, you can simply feed cauliflower florets through the juicer and collect the residual crumb and mix this directly with the remaining pizza base ingredients.

Spread some chocolate icing over the first cake then top with the other cake (from which you will also have carefully removed the baking sheet). Ice the cake all over with the chocolate icing with a palette knife. So it does not get too messy you can place some long strips of baking paper around the edges of the cake while you ice it.

668,Rustic Sundried Tomato Bread,"130g gluten-free plain flour, plus extra for handling
100g gram flour
1 tbsp baking powder
5 sundried tomatoes, plus 2 tbsp of their oil
150ml almond milk – or your favourite dairy-free milk
1 tsp cider vinegar – or 1 tbsp lemon juice ","Makes 1 loafPreheat the oven to 220c.
Place all of the dried ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir together. Next add the sundried tomatoes and toss together in the flours so that the pieces become coated – this will allow them to become evenly distributed.
Pour over the almond milk, oil and cider vinegar (or lemon juice) and then mix together until you have a large, tacky ball of dough. Coat your hands in extra flour and carefully lift the loose dough and place on to a large baking tray, shaping it into a round loaf approximately 6 inches in diameter.
Score the top of the loaf into 8 segments (you can be quite light with the knife as the dough is so soft). Bake the bread in the oven for 15-18 minutes or until golden and crusty. Remove from the oven, leave to cool for 10 minutes and then cut into segments and enjoy.

672,Beer Battered Chicken Bites,"1/2 cup of chicken-style pieces
1 1/2 cup plain flour
1tsp baking powder
1 x 375ml of chilled vegan beer/lager (I used Coors Light but as long as it is vegan feel free to choose your personal favourite)
1/2tsp each of salt
pepper
onion powder and garlic powder
2tsp dried mixed herbs
Around 400ml of oil for frying but the exact amount depends on the size of your fryer.","You’ll need to pre-heat the oil in your deep fryer.
If your chicken-style pieces are frozen then begin by defrosting them ready for use.Add together all of the dry ingredients – flour, baking powder and dried seasonings – and combine well.
Make a well in the centre of the dried ingredients and add the bottle of chilled beer. Stir well to combine until a smooth batter has formed.
You can drop a small amount of batter into the frying oil if you need to check to see if it is hot enough. The oil will sizzle and the batter begin to puff up if the oil is indeed hot enough.
Dip the chicken-style pieces into the batter and, once fully coated, drop carefully into the oil. You may need to do this in several batches if you have only a small fryer so be patient and be sure not to overcrowd the fryer because the batter needs enough room to properly cook.
Fry for 5 minutes or so, until crispy and golden in appearance, and then transfer to a paper towel in order to remove the oily residue.
Serve up as a side dish to any Chinese meal, with chips and ketchup or even as a snack on its own with sweet chilli sauce.

679,"Zoodles with Pesto, Rocket and Roasted Tomatoes and Chickpeas","3 x zucchini (courgettes)
Half a jar of vegan pesto
Kalamata olives (optional – I love them!)
About a dozen baby plum tomatoes – halved
A few good handfuls of rocket
Smoked paprika
Cayenne Pepper
Can of chickpeas
Oregano
Celery Salt
Garlic Granules
Olive Oil","Serves 2-4, depending on portion size!Preheat your oven to 220C
Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas in cold water. Pour onto a clean tea towel and dry off as much of the moisture as possible. Pour into a bowl and add a splash of olive oil and a half a teaspoon of each of the following: cayenne pepper, oregano, celery salt and garlic granules (I made up this mix when I was trying to find a recipe for roasted chickpeas but didn’t quite have the right spices/herbs in stock – it is now my favourite, but you can experiment with any flavours you like really), and mix well. Pour onto a baking sheet so that all the chickpeas are flat and roast for 20 minutes. Set aside.
At the same time the chickpeas are roasting you can also roast the tomatoes. I simply lay my halved tomatoes out on a small baking tray, sprinkle with smoked paprika and bung in the oven. No oil or anything else. I think it is personal preference how roasted you like tomatoes, so I leave mine in for slightly less than the chick peas – about 15 minutes. Once cooked to your liking, set aside.
While the chickpeas and tomatoes are roasting, make your zoodles. You basically want to zoodle as much of the three zucchini as possible. (This is a really fun thing to make with someone else, as you can have ‘Who can make the best/longest zoodle’ competitions!)
I like my zoodles practically raw, so this next part is pretty quick…
On a very low heat, pour about half a jar of vegan pesto into a pan and add your roast tomatoes and olives. Gradually add the zoodles, mixing all the time to coat them with the pesto mix. Once all mixed in they are ready to serve.
Wash your rocket and put a good handful onto each plate.
Spoon the zoodle mixture on top of the rocket and the sprinkle with as many of the roasted chickpeas as you desire.

688,Stuffed Butternut Squash with Maple Syrup and Freekeh,"For the butternut:1 butternut squash
1 tsp coconut oil (solid)
2 tsp pure maple syrup
½ tsp cinnamon
10g fresh thymeFor the stuffing:100g freekeh
500ml water
1 tsp oil
250g chestnut mushrooms (dried mushrooms, such as porcini, would also work well)
1 red onion
4 cloves garlic
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
10g fresh thyme
20g dried sour cherries
30g pecans, chopped into small pieces","Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
To prepare the butternut, use a sharp knife to top and tail it and then cut lengthways down the middle. Scoop out the seeds and stringy bits using a spoon. Next, slice a criss-cross pattern across the flesh – this ensures the butternut can soak up all of the lovely coconut oil and maple syrup (and helps it to cook more quickly).
Drizzle half of the maple syrup onto each half of the butternut and into the scooped-out cavity, followed by the oil (the oil can be melted in advance, or spread on solid). Sprinkle on the cinnamon and thyme leaves.
Place on a baking tray and cook for 45 minutes to an hour. It may take longer depending on the size of the butternut; just keep an eye on it (and cover with foil if you think it’s at risk of burning). It should turn a lovely caramelised brown, and should be soft, but not mushy.
While the butternut is cooking, prepare the freekeh. This usually involves simmering it in water for about 15 minutes, but check the instructions on the packet.
Chop the onion, garlic and mushrooms and heat the oil in a frying pan. Cook on a medium heat with the dried chilli flakes until the onions are soft and lightly browned. Add the thyme leaves, cherries and pecans and give it all a stir, helping the cherries to absorb the lovely flavours. The aroma is amazing! Add the freekeh, stir to combine and remove from the heat.
To serve, pile some spoonfuls of the lovely stuffing into the butternut and reserve some for the table (or to eat the next day in a tasty salad).",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/butternut-header-400x267.jpg,0,93

1 clove garlic, crushed
200g/7oz mushrooms, chopped if medium or large, left whole if small button variety
One of the protein options as mentioned in Preparation
6 tsp vegan gravy granules (plain Bisto is fine) made up with 300g/12fl oz boiling water
1 tbsp porcini mushrooms, soaked in boiled water then chopped into small pieces with scissors. Reserve the soaking water and include it in the 300ml needed for the gravy – see above
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp mixed dried herbs
1-2 tsp shoyu or tamari type soya sauce
2 tbsp sherry or red wine
100g/3oz frozen peas
Black pepper (gravy granules and soya sauce should provide enough salt)
Pie Crust:
1 pack Jus-Rol puff pastry sheet (sold fresh or frozen in most supermarkets) OR a pack of Jus-Rol solid puff pastry, rolled out by hand
Oil spray or a little vegetable oil
A little soya or other unsweetened plant milk (almond, coconut, hemp) to brush top of pastry
","Choose from ONE of the four protein options below:Tempeh, 225g pack. Steam for about 5 minutes then chop into cubes and fry in a little oil and drizzle with soya sauce
Frozen tofu, 225g pack or thereabouts. Freezing tofu gives it a more solid, chewy texture. Chop it into cubes then place in a plastic tub with an airtight lid in the freezer. Defrost before using and fry in hot oil until golden brown and drizzle with soya sauce.
Seitan (wheat gluten). Yakso brand 350g jars from health food shops OR Companion brand plain gluten or veggie chicken, 300g tins from Oriental grocers – drain each of these. Any liquid can be incorporated into the pie’s gravy.
TVP dried chunks, about 10-15, soaked in hot stock for 20-30 minutes until soft enough to cook.If using tofu, chop it into about 16 cubes and freeze overnight. Remove it from the freezer a few hours before you make the pie.
If using tempeh, it can be chopped with a big sharp knife while frozen. Otherwise leave it to defrost in the fridge a few hours before it is needed. Prepare as above.
If using TVP chunks, soak them in hot stock for a few minutes while you prepare everything else. Drain and squeeze gently before adding to pie.
If using seitan/gluten, drain, reserve liquid and set aside until ready.
Pre-heat oven to 225°C/450°F/Gas Mark 7.
Heat olive oil in a medium-large saucepan.
Sauté (gently fry) onion and garlic until onion is translucent – about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes.
Add the protein option of choice and gently stir in with rest of vegetables to coat with oil.
Make the gravy as above then add the mustard, herbs, soya sauce and sherry/wine and mix in well.
Add the peas, porcini mushrooms, gravy mixture and all other ingredients to the pie filling (except the pastry and soya milk).
Stir carefully to mix in well, taste and season if necessary, then turn down heat and leave to simmer.
Meanwhile, choose an oven-proof dish (or individual oven-proof dishes) that will hold the pie filling.
Use its shape to cut out a pastry lid – or several small shapes if you are using individual pie containers. Lightly oil a non-stick baking sheet or tray and place the pastry lid(s) on it. If using several lids space them out on the baking tray.
Brush with a little soya or other plant milk and bake in the hot oven for approximately 20 minutes, or according to the packet instructions – the pastry should be well risen and golden brown.
Spoon the stew into dish or dishes, place the pastry lid(s) on top and serve immediately.Did you enjoy this pie? Check out this veggie curry pie recipe.

696,Non-Dairy Gorgonzola,"½ block (7 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu (not silken tofu)
¼ cup organic refined coconut oil (not virgin coconut oil)
2 tbsp mellow white miso paste
4 tsp white wine or champagne vinegar
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp fine sea salt or kosher salt
½ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp garlic powder
⅛ tsp blue-green algae powder (spirulina)","For this cheese you will need a glass, ceramic, metal or BPA-free plastic container which will hold a minimum of 1 and ½ cup liquid; this will act as the form to shape the cheese. This recipe yields about 8 ounces.Line the form with plastic wrap or a double-layer of cheesecloth, being sure to leave some excess hanging over the sides. This will help lift the cheese from the form after firming.
Drain and press the tofu until it is not releasing any more liquid. It is essential to dry the tofu as much as possible for the proper texture. Crumble the tofu into a food processor.
Remove the metal lid from the jar of coconut oil and place the jar in a microwave. Heat just until the solid oil liquefies, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (this will depend upon the solidity of the coconut oil). Alternately, place the jar in about an inch of simmering water and melt the oil in the same manner. Measure ¼ cup and add to the food processor with the remaining ingredients except for the algae powder. Process the contents until very smooth.
Transfer the cheese mixture to a bowl. Dot the cheese in several spots with the algae powder and fold (rather than stir) the cheese over a few times to create swirls of blue-green color. Transfer the cheese to the lined form. Pack the mixture with the back of a spoon and smooth the surface as best you can. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours. This will ensure that the coconut oil has completely solidified.
Lift the cheese from the container and slice or crumble as needed. Store the cheese wrapped in plastic wrap or in a zip-lock bag in the refrigerator. Because this cheese is made with miso, a fermented product, the flavor will continue to develop as it ages. Try aging the cheese for a minimum of one week before using for the best flavor.Like this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.

700,Shortcrust cookies / Mürbeteigplätzchen,"1 part = 100 grams sugar = 1/2 cup
2 parts = 200 grams fat (vegan butter or margarine) = 7/8 cup
3 parts = 300 grams flour = 2 cups + 1 tbl","There is no source or reference for this recipe, it’sconsidered folk wisdom here. I learned it from Grandma whoprobably learned it from hers and so on. Some people refer tothis dough as 1-2-3-Teig (1-2-3-Dough) because that’s how theingredients are measured: one part sugar, two parts fat, threeparts parts flour. These proportions refer to the weight ofthe ingredients, they don’t work with volume measurements. Iconverted the measurements for my standard recipe for you. Itmakes about 40 cookies (2 inches in diameter each):
1 part = 100 grams sugar = 1/2 cup
2 parts = 200 grams fat (vegan butter or margarine) = 7/8 cup
3 parts = 300 grams flour = 2 cups + 1 TBL
As you can see, there is no additional binding agent. Which iswhy this dough only works if you keep everything cold. Coldingredients, cold kitchen supplies, cold hands. I mix it in ametal bowl that I cool under very cold water before use soeven the mixing bowl is cold.The butter needs to be very cold and firm.If you’re usingvegan margarine I recommend you put it in the freezerfor an hour or so to make it firmer.
Cut the very cold butter in chunks and place themin a cold, large bowl.Sift the flour over the butter chunks.Mix flour and butter chunks with your hands quickly, usingyour fingers to squish the butter chunks. Both ingredientswill make a smooth dough in about a minute. Don’t knead toolong, it gets crumbly very quickly.
When the flour and butter are just combined, add the sugar andknead in quickly. As soon as all ingredients are mixed, stopkneading. Form the dough into a roll of about 2 inches indiameter, firmly wrap the roll into cling film and keep it inthe fridge for at least an hour. I keep it in a metal dish andadd the knife I’m going to use to cut the cookies. That way,the knife is cold, too.
Set a timer so you don’t forget to preheat the oven to180C/356F at least 15 minutes before the cooling time for thedough is over. Take the dough out of the fridge and unwrap. Itwill be very firm now. You can now cut the dough in evenslices of about 0.4 cm / 1/16 inch.
Line a baking tray with parchment and even the edges of thecookies a bit with your fingers before you place them on thebaking tray. I bake them in two batches, the dough makes about40 cookies, they wouldn’t fit on one tray.Put the tray in the oven and bake for about 9-10 minutes. Istart to watch the cookies after 8 minutes because they burnquickly. They will melt a little while baking. When the sides
start to brown, they’re done but still tender.Take the cookies from the baking tray quickly and let themcool on a cooling tray. Even if you work with two bakingtrays, it’s not enough to take the tray out of the oven. It’sstill hot enough to burn the cookies after taking them out ofthe oven. They are still a little soft when they’re fresh fromthe oven and need to cool completely to firm up and turncrispy.
Done.
The one negative thing about those shortcrust cookies?They need to rest for a couple of days in a cookie jar or tinto reach their perfect texture.
Once you’ve mastered working with this shortcrust dough, thevariations are endless:Sprinkle them with sugar before baking.
Add lemon zest to the dough and cover the cookies withlemon icing after cooling.
Add chopped hazelnuts to the dough.
Stick two cookies together with a layer of homemaderaspberry fudge in the middle. Dip those double deckercookies in dark chocolate and let them cool.Guten Appetit!

2 tablespoons of vegan-friendly red pesto
12 lasagne sheets
100g grated vegan cheese
 
For the creamy bechamel:
70g vegan butter
70g plain flour
200ml Elmlea Plant Double (or your choice of dairy-free cream)
650ml plant-based milk
4 tbsp of nutritional yeast
","Preheat the oven to 200°C / 392°F. Top and tail the carrots then slice them into1/2cm thick rings. Add them to a large baking tray, sprinkle with small pinches of salt and pepper and drizzle with a light splash of olive oil. Toss through with your hands then roast for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, remove the stems from the red peppers and dice them. Then top and tail the courgettes and peel the red onions then slice both into 1/2cm rings. Finely chop the rosemary leaves.
Add the red peppers, courgettes, red onion and rosemary to the baking tray with the carrots along with small pinches of salt and pepper and a light drizzle of olive oil. Toss with a spoon to combine everything together. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes.
Drizzle a little olive oil in a medium saucepan on a medium heat. Peel and dice the garlic cloves then throw them into the saucepan and fry for 2 minutes. Next add the tinned tomatoes and small pinches of salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, add the vegan butter to a frying pan over a medium heat. Once melted, add the flour, stir to combine and fry for 2 minutes. Pour in the cream and whisk regularly so that the sauce becomes smooth. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking continuously so the sauce remains smooth. Season with pinches of salt and pepper, then add the nutritional yeast. Continue stirring until the sauce begins to thicken.
To build the lasagne, first add a few large spoonfuls of the tomato sauce to a large roasting dish and spread evenly. Then layer with 4 sheets of lasagne, followed by a few spoonfuls of bechamel. Next evenly spread 1/3 of the roasted vegetables on top. Repeat one more time starting again with a few spoonfuls of tomato sauce until you have 2 layers of lasagne sheets. Next later with a few spoonfuls of tomato sauce, 4lasagne sheets, and a few spoonfuls of bechamel. Next evenly spread the pesto over the bechamel and then layer with the remaining roasted vegetables. Finish with the last few spoonfuls of tomato sauce. Next sprinkle over the grated vegan cheese and finally spoon the remaining bechamel over the top. Spread the bechamel out evenly over the top of the lasagne.
Roast in the oven for 30-35 mins or until golden on top. Leave to sit for at least 10 mins before serving.

706,Caramelised Onion Dip with Warm Foccacia,"For the Caramelized Onion Dip:
100g cashew nuts
The juice of 1½ lemons
1 large white onion
1 tbsp garlic oil 
1 tsp light soft brown sugar
For the Foccacia:
225g/8oz gluten free plain flour
4 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp xanthan gum
1 heaped tsp egg replacer, whisked together with 2 tbsp water 
250 ml hot water
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
Stems of rosemary, optional
A pinch of sea salt flakes","You will need a 9 ½ x 6 ½ inch/24cm x 16cm baking tin for this recipeDip:
Place the cashew nuts in a bowl and cover with water, leave to soak overnight or for a minimum of 4 hours.
Once soaked, drain the cashews from the water and place in a high powered blender with the juice of 1 lemon and 100ml of water. Blitz together, stopping regularly to scrape down the sides, until you have a smooth and creamy consistency. You can do this in a food processor (the smaller the bowl the better) but it will take you a lot longer and you may find that the final result is a little grainier than it should be. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Next, peel and finely slice the onion into half moons. Heat the garlic oil into a heavy based frying pan until hot, add the sliced onion, the remaining lemon juice, a good pinch of sea salt and the brown sugar. Fry over a low heat until the onions are soft and caramelised – about 25 minutes.
Fold the onions into the cashew cream mixture until combined, season to taste and then chill until ready to use. This spread will last for up to 3 days if refrigerated.
Foccacia:
Preheat the oven to 200c and liberally grease the baking tin with olive oil. Place the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, egg replacer and oil into a food processor, pour over of the water and blitz until you have a smooth and creamy dough – it should be dropping consistency but not completely liquid.
Alternatively, make up the egg replacer in a large mixing bowl, add the remaining dry ingredients, stir together and then add the remaining water, bit by bit, beating together until smooth and creamy.
Pour the mixture into the tin, level the top with the back of a spoon, pushing it into the corners of the tin and spreading it evenly. Now, use your fingertip to mark little dents and hills all over the dough – because it is such a liquid batter, you won’t be able to make solid holes, instead, just create little peaks and troughs in the surface of the bread.

708,Millionaire Caramel Brownies,"FOR THE BROWNIES:
2 tsp psyllium husk powder + 7 tsp water 175 g vegan butter
100g dark cocoa powder
1 tbsp espresso powder
300g caster sugar
90g plain flour
3/4 tsp flaky sea salt
4 tbsp plant milk
100g vegan dark choc chips (most chocolate over 64% cocoa is dairy-free)
FOR THE CARAMEL
170g vegan butter
200g golden syrup (corn syrup also works great)
170g soft dark brown sugar
100g caster sugar
150ml plant milk
1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste
Pinch flaky sea salt
FOR THE CHOCOLATE:
200g vegan dark chocolate (minimum 60% cacao)
","To Make the BrowniesPreheat the oven to 170c. Line a brownie tray with baking parchment.
In a small bowl, mix the psyllium husk powder with the water and set aside.
In a medium saucepan over low heat, add the vegan butter and allow to melt completely.
To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the cocoa powder and the espresso powder and mix well. Add the melted butter along with the caster sugar and the psyllium egg mixture and beat well.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour and the salt. Add half of the flour mixture to the stand mixer and beat until combined. Add half of the plant milk and beat until combined. Add the remaining flour mixture and beat until combined followed by the remaining plant milk.
Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and add the chocolate chips. With a silicone spatula, mix until the chocolate chips are evenly distributed.
Pour or spoon the brownie batter into the prepared baking tray. Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes. The edges should be quite firm but the centre will be a little jiggly when you remove it from the oven.
Place on a cooling rack and allow to cool fully to room temperature. Once cooled, chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.To Make the CaramelIn a large saucepan add all the caramel ingredients except for the vanilla and the salt. Place over a medium/low heat and stir with a heat-proof spatula until all the butter is melted and the sugars dissolved completely.
Using a probe thermometer, bring the caramel to 115c (you may have to increase the heat to get it there, but trust me, it will get there!).
Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and salt and stir continuously (off the heat!) for around 10 minutes while the caramel cools. It will thicken dramatically!
Once thick, set aside and allow to cool for a further 5-10 minutes (it should still be runny enough to pour or spoon over the chilled brownies, so keep checking the texture regularly).
Pour or spoon over the brownies in the tin, even out with your spoon and then return to the fridge for at least 30 minutes.To Make the ChocolateChop the chocolate roughly into small pieces. Place in a medium heat-proof bowl and sit over a small pan of boiling water. Allow the steam from the water to heat the bowl and melt the chocolate, stirring constantly with a spatula.
Pour the chocolate over the chilled caramel and then set aside on the counter to set fully (not in the fridge). Once set, slice with a hot knife (otherwise the chocolate will crack) into squares or bars and serve!",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-05-Millionaire-Caramel-Vegan-Brownies-Might-Be-The-Most-Indulgent-Dessert-400x266.png,1,296
709,Perfectly Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes,"1 3/4 cups (260 grams) all purpose flour
3/4 cup + 1 Tb. (175 grams) granulated sugar
3/4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 Tb. apple cider vinegar
1 Tb. + 1 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 cup canola oil (rapeseed oil)Sweet Vanilla Frosting2/3 cup non-hydrogenated vegetable shortening
2 cups powdered sugar (icing sugar)
2 Tb. unsweetened almond milk
1/8 tsp. salt","First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Then, line 12 spots in a cupcake tin with paper liners.
In a small bowl, combine the wet ingredients: almond milk, apple cider vinegar, vanilla extract, and oil. Set aside. You may notice the milk will start to curdle, but don’t worry! It’s suppose to.
In a separate medium-sized bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt. Stir well.
Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients while stirring. Make sure all flour is scraped from the sides and bottom of the bowl. Be mindful to not over mix.
Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners just until they are about 3/4 full. Use a second cupcake tin with extra paper liners, if needed.
Bake on the top rack of your preheated oven for 19-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted down the center of each cupcake comes out clean with no batter. Allow them to sit in the tin for 5 minutes before carefully transferring them to a cooling rack.
Cool completely before frosting, about 1 1/2 – 2 hours.
While the cupcakes cool, use this time to make your frosting. Using an electric stand or hand mixer, cream the shortening on a medium speed for about 30 seconds.
Then, add half of the powdered sugar and half of the almond milk and mix on high for about 30 seconds.
Next, add the salt and remaining sugar and almond milk. Mix on high again for another 30 seconds. If you feel the frosting should be slightly thicker, add a spoonful or so more of powdered sugar. For slightly thinner frosting, add a splash or two of almond milk – but be careful – a little goes a long way!
Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spoon or spatula and incorporate what was stuck to the sides into the frosting.
Frost cupcakes the old fashioned way with a butter knife or offset spatula, or place the frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a decorating tip!Enjoy!

710,Vegan Cream Cheese,"*4 cups soya milk (Unsweetened) 946ml/32 oz 
2 tbsp lemon juice
1½ tsp sea salt
¾ tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 – 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
** 1/3 cup refined coconut oil
* this recipe only works with unsweetened soya milk
** use refined coconut oil to avoid your cheese being coconut flavoured","Place a sieve over a deep pot or pan. Lay the cheese cloth in the sieve. I fold mine so it’s quadruple thickness. (You could use a thin, clean tea towel if you don’t have cheesecloth). This is where you will pour your milk to make the cheese when it is ready. It’s important that your pot is deep so the cheese doesn’t come into contact with the liquid.
In a large pan, over medium-high heat, simmer the soy milk until it reaches a light boil. Stir constantly with a whisk and watch the milk carefully so it does not boil over. It is important to continue stirring the entire time your milk is on the hob.
Once the soy milk comes to a light, rolling boil, add the lemon juice and stir. After about 30 seconds you should see some curdling start to occur (the solid of the milk will start to separate from the liquids).
Add the sea salt. Turn down the heat and stir for another minute or so. At this point your milk should be really curdled. You may see chunks or your curdled milk may be of a finer grain due to the whisk.
Stir in the nutritional yeast (dependent on how cheesy you want it to taste) and apple cider vinegar into the milk mixture and whisk lightly.
Pour the milk over the cheese cloth. Be careful because the milk will be very hot.
Tightly tie the cheesecloth at the top. Place a weight on top of the cheese cloth to help it drain faster and the cheese to solidify. Anything will do such as cans of food or a stack of ramekins.
Place in the fridge overnight. In the morning, the whey will have separated from the milk into the bottom bowl. Carefully unwrap your cheese.
Melt the coconut oil (20-30 seconds in the microwave on high will do). Put the cheese and oil in a blender and blend for around 30 seconds. It will be very thick but you just want to get an even texture. The oil gives the cheese the right ‘mouth feel’.
Transfer to a small dish, cover and refrigerate. This will last up to 2 weeks in the fridge.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image61-400x351.jpg,6,198
711,Strawberry and Cream Cupcakes,"200g strawberries, plus a few extra to decorate
100ml sunflower oil
100g golden caster sugar
4 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 6 tbsp water
180g gluten free self raising flour
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
For the vanilla buttercream icing:
55g dairy-free sunflower margarine – I always use Pure
30ml rice milk or other dairy-free milk
½ tsp vanilla extract
250g golden icing sugar","Strawberries, raspberries, apples, even rhubarb would all work (the latter two would have to be cooked down with a little sugar first) and then topped with a generous spread of Vanilla Buttercream Icing. They’re perfect for an afternoon tea or a children’s tea party.
Makes 12 Cupcakes
Preheat the oven to 180c and line a 12 hole muffin or cupcake tray with paper cases.
Hull the strawberries and place in a mixing bowl. Use a fork to mash the strawberries until pulpy and juicy.
Pour the oil into a large mixing bowl, add the sugar and beat together until combined. Stir in the flaxseed and water mixture until combined (it will be slightly tacky in consistency). Add the strawberries and flour and use a metal spoon to fold them into the mixture until mixed.
Spoon the mixture evenly into the cupcake cases, level the tops and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Meanwhile, make the buttercream icing. Place the margarine, rice milk and vanilla extract into a mixing bowl, sift over half of the icing sugar and use an electric whisk to mix the ingredients together. I recommend using an electric whisk as it takes some time to get the icing mixture to the right creamy consistency – about 4 minutes. By all means do it by hand but it may take you much longer. Sift in the remaining icing sugar and continue to whisk until thick, glossy and creamy. Place the icing in the fridge to chill until ready to spread.
Once the cupcakes are completely cool, spread liberally with the icing and decorate with the fresh strawberries.

Repeat this process several times until mushrooms are condensed and pressed into light golden brown pieces with no liquid in the pan.NOTE:Depending on the mushrooms (cause they’re all different) some will leach more liquid than others. Don’t fret it might take a couple minutes longer to cook but the liquid will dissipate.

2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp dried sage
2 tbsp paprika
2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
Kosher salt
1 cup all-purpose flour

For the buttermilk:
1 cup vegan buttermilk (1 cup of soya milk and 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, whisked together and left to sit for 5 – 10 mins)
1 tsp hot sauce
Pinch of salt
Oil for frying","Make the seitan following the instructions below:There are loads of recipes for seitan and I am working my way through them, learning as I go. For this recipe I tried one by Isa Chandra (Chicken Stylee Seitan, available on thePPK.com) and because it was a big batch I tried a couple of different ways of cooking it. I think either way would work and I would definitely try the boiled method for this recipe next time.I followed the recipe by Isa Chandra up to the point of cooking. At that point, I separated the seitan dough in to two batches. With one, I followed the recipe, gentry cooking the seitan in stock. This was the most successful of my attempts so far. It is really, really important not to let it boil. I got all tech about it and dragged out the jam thermometer. I kept it between 94 and 98 degrees.Anyway, for this particular version, I took the other half of the seitan and formed it in to small nuggets. Keep them on the small side because they will expand on cooking. I put them on an oiled baking tray and covered them with tin foil and baked for 20 – 30 mins at 180oC. Keep an eye on them, they are only small so it won’t take much to burn them. My thinking with this was that it keep them dry and therefore make the coating stick better.If you have the time, the stock method would work too but you would want to leave them to drain for quite a while and get as much stock out of them as you can before trying to do the coating.If you don’t fancy making your own seitan or you have your own preferred product or recipe, you could just use that. If you are still searching for that perfect recipe, give Isa’s recipe a go.You will need 2 bowls and a drying rack to complete all of the coating process and to also drain off the seitan once cooked.Start off by making the vegan butter milk. Combine the ingredients and then let sit for 5 to 10 mins whilst you get all the ingredients for the flour together and mix them well in a bowl. By the time you have got them all sorted, your buttermilk should be good to go.In your second bowl, mix the buttermilk with the hot sauce and salt. You are now ready to being the coating process.Add the seitan to the buttermilk and let soak for 10 mins. One soaked, add the pieces a few at a time to the flour and coat well before putting on the drying rack and leaving for another 5 to 10 mins. You can use this time to get your oil heated up. You want it at 180oC. Be careful, don’t burn your house down or anything.Once the seitan pieces have sat in the coating for 10 mins, we repeat the coating process. This helps more of the flour stick and also creates all sort of lumps, bumps and crevices which are going to make this really good. Straight in to the buttermilk, straight in to the flour and then in to the 180oC oil.The most important tip I found was to leave the pieces along for at least 3 minutes otherwise you risk knocking the coating off. Overall mine took about 8 mins to get nice and golden. My pan was not big enough to cook the whole lot and yours probably won’t be either so I did a couple of batches and kept the first batch warm in a low oven. I chucked the first batch in the oil again for a minute at the end, just because.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_5929-400x400.jpg,15,302

716,Gazpacho,"500g large heirloom or vine tomatoes (that’s about 6 large or about 12 regular sized tomatoes)
1 small red onion
1 small cucumber
The juice of 1 orange

1 clove garlic
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
A small bunch of fresh parsley
A small bunch of fresh coriander
4 soaked pitted dates
1 tsp ground cumin
A small pinch of chilli powder","This recipe also calls for soaked dates: I recommend you cover the dates in a little boiling water (just enough to cover) for an hour before making. Alternatively you can use medjool dates (don’t forgot to remove the stones!) which are much softer and also larger, so halve the number required. It’s also really nice to use a mix of tomatoes if you can – yellow, red, plum, cherry, heirloom etc. It just looks so beautiful in the bowl, but if you can only get standard tomatoes then I recommend going for a mix of large and cherry, all on the vine for added flavour.Place half of the tomatoes (choose the prettier ones to chop up later) into a blender with the juice of the orange and lemon, clove of garlic, cider vinegar, dates, cumin, chilli and oil.
Blitz until completely smooth and then add the fresh herbs and pulse verybriefly until just incorporated-if you blend the herbs too long the gazpacho will turn brown instead of a rich red colour.
Finely dice the remaining tomatoes, cucumber and onion. Place in a large mixing bowl and then pour the blended mixture over the top.

732,Decadent Chocolate Tart,"120g walnuts and pecans, or use sunflower seeds if making nut free [UK 4.2oz]
100g dessicated coconut [UK 3.5oz]

2 Tbsp cocoa powder [UK 1oz]
50 – 80 ml water [UK 1.8 – 2.8fl oz / USA 1.7 – 2.7 fl oz]
A pinch of sea salt
160g cocoa powder [UK 5.6oz / USA a little less than 3/4 cups]

210g coconut oil [UK 7.4oz]
The above measurements have been converted to meet universal standards and every effort has been taken to ensure accuracy.Discover more decadent vegan dessert recipes! 
","Firstly, line the cake tin with a sheet of cling film, laying it as smoothly as possible inside the tin.
Next, place the walnuts, coconut and cocoa powder into a food processor and pulse until of a fine breadcrumb consistency.
Add the dates and the pinch of sea salt and continue to pulse, and then add the minimum amount of water, pulsing as you go, until the mixture combines and pulls together. You can add the remaining water if you feel like the mixture isn’t holding together.
Transfer the base mixture into the cake tin and press down lightly with your fingers to spread it over the base of the tin, then, using a spoon, smooth out the top layer of the mixture so that it forms an even base.
Place in the fridge and leave to chill while you make the topping.
Place the cocoa powder, maple syrup and coconut oil in a blender – I recommend using a high powered blender instead of a food processor as it will give you a creamier result.
Blitz the ingredients until you have a completely smooth, creamy filling – this may take a few minutes.
Pour the chocolate ganache filling over the base of the tart, level the top with the back of a spoon and then chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours before serving.A little tip, when ready to serve, run a large knife under the hot tap before slicing the tart, repeat for every slice as this will give you the smoothest, leanest slices of tart.

735,Turmeric & Sweet Potato Falafels,"240g/8½oz chickpeas (or 1 tin drained)
300g/10oz sweet potatoes (or 1 medium sized)
2 large cloves garlic
1 handful fresh coriander leaves
¼ teaspoon ground cardamon
heaped teaspoon ground turmeric (or 1 heaped tablespoon of freshly grated)
2 teaspoons heaped ground coriander
1 teaspoon heaped ground cumin
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 heaped teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons gram flour (chickpea flour)
Extra gram flour for rolling with","Scrub and chop the sweet potato and boil until soft with skin still included (approximately 10 minutes). Then drain and place in a mixing bowl.
Crush garlic and chop along with coriander leaves (as small as you can) with a sharp knife.
Add all ingredients into blender or food processor (EXCEPT the gram flour). I find this actually works best with a hand (immersion) blender. With a hand blender, you can apply downward pressure and get in there nicely… if you use a jug blender or food processor it will work fine if you keep scraping down the sides and loosen the mixture. Alternatively you could go for the real rustic effect and use a strong potato masher to do the job instead. Blend until most of the mixture is broken down. It doesn’t need to be totally smooth; it can be quite rustic.
Once blended add the gram flour and continue to mix in with a spoon. If you leave it on the side for a while (half and hour or half a day) then it will firm up a little making it slightly easier to roll. I sometimes let it stand if I have time, but that’s not essential.
Chickpea moisture varies from batch to batch. The mixture should be soft and pliable, easy to roll into a ball in your hands. Take a heaped teaspoon worth of mixture and roll a small ball (this should be smaller than a golf ball). The delightful yellowness glow of the turmeric will rub off a bit on your hands. If you’d rather now yellow-out your hands then use extra gram flour to roll with. If your mixture is too soft to roll well, then add a little extra gram flour or use gram flour to roll in.
Place on a lightly oiled baking tray and bake in preheated oven at gas mark 6 or 7 (200˚C to 220˚C/ 400˚F to 425˚F) for approximately 30 minutes or until tanned.

743,"Chocolate, Cherry and Honeycomb Parfait","For the honeycomb:
5 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tbsp golden syrup
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
For the parfait:
200g dark, dairy-free chocolate
150g dairy-free margarine or coconut oil (at room temperature)
2 tbsp golden syrup
85g blanched almonds, or use the same weight in favourite gluten free, vegan biscuits if you can’t have nuts, or stem ginger instead for extra flavour
85g glace cherries
100g dried cranberries","Serves 8
You will need a 450g/1lb loaf tin for this recipeBegin by making the honeycomb. Generously grease a flat baking tray with vegetable oil. Melt the granulated sugar and golden syrup in a high sided saucepan over a low heat. Once melted, turn up the heat a little and bubble the syrup until it turns to a rich, caramel gold colour. Whisk in the bicarbonate of soda – this will make the syrup foam up, hence the high sided pan – and immediately pour the mixture onto your greased baking tray. Set the tray aside and leave it to cool for 20 minutes, before sliding the honeycomb off and chopping it roughly into small chunks for the parfait.
Next, line the loaf tin with enough cling film to allow it to drape over the edges by about 3 inches, smoothing the cling film into the tin to form a crease free base.
Break up the dark chocolate and roughly chop the almonds. Place the chocolate, golden syrup and margarine in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, stir together until melted and combined to a smooth and glossy finish.
Take the bowl off the heat and stir in the chopped honeycomb, almonds, cherries and cranberries. Spoon the mixture into the lined tin and level the top. Fold the overhanging cling film loosely over the top of the parfait and then place in the freezer for 1 hour, remove from the freezer and transfer the parfait to the fridge until set. Once ready to serve, carefully lift the parfait from the tin, unwrap the cling film and cut into 2 cm slices to serve.Like this recipe?

748,Jackfruit Ceviche,"1 can (20 oz) green jackfruit in water or brine
½ cup peeled and small diced tomato
½ cup peeled, seeded and small diced cucumber
¼ cup small diced onion
¼ cup chopped cilantro
1 clove garlic, minced
1 small Serrano chili, seeded and finely minced
Juice of 1 lime
1 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp fine sea salt or kosher salt, or more to taste
¼ tsp coarse ground black pepper
¼ tsp ground cumin
½ ripe but firm avocado, diced","Canned green jackfruit bears a resemblance to flaked crabmeat when cooked. It can be found in Indian and Asian markets or purchased through the internet. Look for the label “Green Jackfruit” or “Young Green Jackfruit” and be sure that it’s packed in water or brine and not syrup. Cans of ripe jackfruit packed in syrup may be stocked nearby, but don’t be tempted to substitute as the ripe fruit will be too sweet for this application.
*Chef’s note: Traditional ceviche made with fresh seafood has a fresh, clean flavor and should not be fishy. If you wish to add a subtle ocean flavor to this plant-based version add a little bit of dried kelp flakes or flaked, toasted nori.
Drain the jackfruit and rinse. If the jackfruit was canned in brine, rinse thoroughly. Add the chunks of jackfruit to 1 quart salted boiling water. Reduce the heat to a slow boil and cook for 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and let cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the tough core from each chunk of jackfruit with a sharp knife and discard. Break the chunks apart with your fingers and remove the soft seeds and seed membranes and discard. The remaining flaky pulp is the only portion you will want to use in the dish, so sort through the chunks carefully (there will be a significant amount of unusable material). Wrap the pulp in a lint-free kitchen towel and squeeze to remove excess water. Coarsely chop the pulp and place in a mixing bowl.
Add the remaining ingredients EXCEPT for the avocado and toss well to combine. Refrigerate for several hours to marinate the ingredients and blend the flavors. Add the diced avocado just before serving and toss well. The avocado can also be placed into a ring mold and the ceviche layered on top for a lovely presentation. Season the ceviche with additional salt as desired and to taste. Serve with crunchy tortilla chips.
Tip: Strips of flour or corn tortilla that have been flash-fried in cooking oil make an interesting and crunchy garnish.Like this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.

750,Vanilla Fudge,"370g Carnation Vegan Condensed Milk Alternative 
120ml plant milk alternative 
350g demerara sugar 
115g vegan spread or butter alternative 
2 tsp vanilla bean extract or vanilla extract 
 
","Line a 20cm square cake tin with baking parchment. Set aside.
Place the ingredients into a large non-stick saucepan and melt over a low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
We like to add a little pinch of salt to the caramel which you can do at the beginning of this step.
Bring to the boil then simmer for 5-8 minutes, stirring continuously and scraping the base of the pan. Take care while the mixture boils and during stirring as the fudge will be VERY hot! To see if it’s ready, drop a little of the mixture into a jug of ice-cold water. A soft ball of fudge should form.
Alternatively, check with a sugar thermometer if you have one (the fudge should be approximately 112-115°C).
Remove the fudge from the heat and leave to cool for 5 minutes. Beat the mixture until it loses its shine and becomes very thick (this should take about 10 minutes).  You’ll have a dead arm but it’s worth it for the best ever vegan fudge!
You can add chopped chocolate, nuts, stem ginger, cookie pieces, alcohol, flavouring extracts whatever you like to the fudge after its cooled and then beat as usual.
Press into the prepared tin with the back of a spoon and leave to set before cutting into squares.
The fudge will keep for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container at room temperature.

Do the same to the tempeh, but this needs to be a bit chunkier. Place it in with the mushrooms.

774,Lemony Courgette Soup with Mint Pesto,"2 tbsp olive oil
2 white onions
1kg large courgettes, a mix of yellow and green preferably organic and not too young.
1 bay leaf
1 ½ tsp herbs de Provence
½ tsp mustard powder
750ml vegetable stock
1 unwaxed lemon
Salt and pepper to season
¼ of a nutmeg plus more for serving
For the pesto:
25g fresh mint, leaves picked
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
60g pine nuts
6 tsp olive oil
1 tsp nutritional yeast
¼ tsp salt","Serves 4Finely chop the onions. Using a heavy based, lidded pan heat 2 tbsp of olive oil and add the onions giving them a quick stir so they get coated in the oil. Pop the lid on the pan and, keeping the heat low, sweat the onion for around 10 mins, stirring occasionally, until translucent. While the onion is cooking you can prepare the courgettes. Give them a wash, and cut away any damaged skin. Slice each courgette in half lengthways and slice into ¼ inch pieces. When the onions are cooked, add the courgettes, bay leaf, herbs de Provence and mustard powder, give them a good stir, and balance the lid back on the pan so it is slightly ajar. The cooking time here will vary a little depending on the size of the courgettes but this should be around 20-25 minutes with the courgettes taking on a translucent appearance when they are cooked.
While the courgettes are cooking, make the pesto. Using a food processor or a pestle and mortar blend together the pine nuts, garlic, mint and 4 tsp of the olive oil. Once a coarse paste is formed add the salt and the nutritional yeast. Give another quick blend so the new ingredients are integrated but the texture of the pesto remains coarse.
Once the courgettes are cooked, add the vegetable stock and grate in the nutmeg. Keeping the pan on a low heat stir well for a minute or two before transferring the contents to the blender (or leave in the pan if using a hand blender). Puree the soup adding some hot water if the soup is too thick, and return to the pan.
Zest the lemon. Cover the zest as it dries out incredibly quickly and set aside until serving. Disposing of any pips, squeeze the juice into the hot soup. Give a quick stir and check the seasoning.
To serve, ladle the soup into the serving bowls and grate over a little nutmeg. Rest a dollop of pesto on top of the soup then scatter over the lemon zest.Like this recipe? Sign up to Veganuary today to get recipes like this delivered directly to your inbox.

775,Spiced Apple Porridge with Grilled Pears,"For the grilled pears:
2 pears
Coconut sugar
Pinch of ground cinnamon
Pinch of ground cloves
Pinch of ground nutmeg
For the porridge:
80g porridge oats
300ml your favourite non dairy milk
approx. 50ml water
1 apple
1/2tsp cinnamon
Pinch of ground cloves
Pinch of ground nutmeg
For topping:
1 tbsp hazelnuts
1 tbsp pumpkin seeds","Wash the pears, slice in half lengthways and scoop out the core. Place on a baking tray and sprinkle with the sugar and spices. Grill the pears for around 20-25 minutes whilst you prepare the porridge.Place a saucepan on a low-medium heat and add the oats, spices and milk.Wash the apple and grate it before adding it to the saucepan straight away before it browns. Stir the porridge well whilst it cooks to ensure you get a nice creamy porridge.Whilst the porridge cooks, heat a frying pan on a high heat and add the hazelnuts. Shake occasionally to prevent burning until the skins start to peel away. Transfer onto some kitchen towel and leave to cool slightly before rubbing in the towel to remove the skins. Meanwhile toast the pumpkin seeds in the frying pan, shaking the pan until they start to pop then transfer into a bowl to cool.When the porridge starts to thicken you may need to add some water, up to 50ml to get your preferred consistency. (I always find how much liquid you require can vary quite dramatically depending on what oats you use). After 15-20 minutes you should have perfect creamy porridge ready to serve.Chop the toasted hazelnuts and sprinkle over along with the pumpkin seeds.

777,Chocolate Blueberry Lovehearts,"Chocolate ingredients:
50g (1¾ oz) raw cocoa butter
50g (1¾ oz) raw cocoa powder
3 tablespoons raw coconut sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Filling ingredients:
70g (2¼oz) fresh blueberries
40g (1½oz) coconut butter
1 medjool date (pitted)
","You will need: A heart-shaped chocolate mould with 12 hearts. You can use any chocolate mould shape if you’d prefer a different shape.
You can also watch a video demonstration of chocolate makingStep One:
‘Shave’ the solid cocoa butter with a sharp knife or grater. Shaving is just really thin slicing that makes the cocoa butter crumble. The finer you can get it, the easier it will be to melt. You can leave it in big chunks if you like, but be prepared to wait a while for it to melt.
Step Two: 
Melt the cocoa butter. You can do this by leaving it in a warm place in a heat proof glass bowl by a fire or directly above a hot radiator. It melts at 34˚C. The idea is to melt it, rather than cook it, maintaining its ‘un-cookedness’. If you don’t have a gentle heat source then use a hob or stove.
Put the cocoa butter in a small, oven proof, glass bowl and then put that bowl in a pan containing an inch or so of really hot water. Keep the hob/stove burning on a low heat. The heat will then transfer through the bowl, enough to melt the cocoa butter. Give it frequent stirs to assist the melting process. Don’t keep it on the heat any longer than it takes to melt it.
The best time to use it is when it has just melted. If it is too hot, then it takes longer to cool down and the coconut sugar will sink to the bottom of the chocolate when added.
Step Three: 
Add the coconut sugar to the melting cocoa butter during step two. The melting cocoa butter will help to soften and dissolve the sugar.
Step Four: 
When the cocoa butter has finally melted, mix in the cocoa powder and any other remaining ingredients.
Here’s the fun part!
Making chocolate hearts:
Place 1 teaspoon of your melted chocolate mixture into each heart-shaped well. When you’ve put some in every heart, pop them into the freezer whilst you prepare and blend the filling ingredients.
Prepare the filling:
Blend all the filling ingredients together thoroughly and leave on the side whilst you make the chocolate.
Making chocolate hearts continued:
Take your hearts out of the freezer (after about 10 minutes worth of chilling) and place the blueberry filling into each one. This is slightly fiddly! Use a teaspoon and a knife to help the process…
Take about ½ a teaspoon of filling and gently dollop it on top of the freshly chilled chocolate hearts. Aim right for the middle of the heart. You’ll find that some always hits the edges… simply tease it back with your knife to create a thin gap at the edges (you’ll see why next).
Take the rest of your melted chocolate (you should have some left – if not – make some more) and pour 2 or 3 teaspoons over each dollop. Place your tray of hearts straight into the freezer to help your chocolates set. This should be ready in about 15 minutes. You can also set them by leaving in the fridge or any cool place (but allow extra time for setting).
Enjoy!

1 tin (240g/8½oz drained or 1½ cups) tinned chickpeas
2 lemons
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
½ teaspoon sea salt","De-seed, de-stalk and slice your peppers in half or quarters.
Next: roast the sweet pepper and garlic in a hot oven… To do this, keep the garlic in its skin and place on an oven tray along with the pepper and place in a pre-heated oven (gas mark 7/425°C/220°F should work fine). Roast garlic for up to 10 minutes and the pepper for about 15-20 minutes (or until the pepper is easy to pierce). No need to let the pepper char.Note: I find it easier to roast this ahead of time – get on with something else – and then set them out to cool for a little while before adding to the rest of the ingredients.
It’s best to wait until the garlic cools down a little before you pop it out of it’s skin. Gently chop off the top; then squeeze out the fleshy garlic and place in a jug ready to blend with everything else.
Rinse and drain chickpeas.
Juice lemon and discard the skin.
Add all ingredients to a jug and blend until you reached your desired consistency.
Chill in the fridge before serving.This serves well with: salad in a sandwich on crackers as a veggie dip with baked potatoes or coconut-sweet-potatoes It’s pretty versatile and should keep in the fridge for over a week.

onions onto it.
Cook the pancake on medium heat, and don’t let it burn.
After a couple of minutes, check whether the pancake is easy to lift off the pan and if the
underside has cooked to golden brown. Add oil to the pancake edge if necessary to lift the
pancake.

225g Brown rice
50g Currants
1 tsp Turmeric
1 tsp Cinnamon
½ tsp Sumac (optional)
1 litre Vegetable stock (I use Bouillon)
Olive oil
Salt and pepper","Tips:If your peppers don’t sit upright in the saucepan because there is space around them, then squeeze an onion or a potato in next to them to make them sit tight.Add some olive oil to the pan of boiling water the peppers cook in. This will add a bit of flavour and soften them up nicely.If you’d prefer to use white rice, just cut out the first stage. Add your rice into the onion mixture without pre-cooking it.Cook the brown rice for half of the time it suggests on the packet.While the rice is cooking you can prep the peppers and filling – Wash the peppers and cut the tops off, making sure the green stalk is still attached so you can use the top of the pepper for a lid. De-seed and place all six in a saucepan so they stand upright. Set aside.Dice the onion and gently fry in a medium sized frying pan with a little olive oil. Dice the courgette into small pieces and add to the pan along with the crushed garlic. Add the currants and spices.By this time your rice should be ready. Drain it and add it to the pan. Stir to combine everything, turn up the heat and add your stock. Once it starts bubbling turn down to a low heat and let simmer until the liquid has evaporated and the rice has fully cooked. Add more liquid if needed. Once cooked, taste and season.Spoon the rice into the peppers, filling them to the top, then place the top of the pepper back on. Repeat, so all six peppers are filled.Carefully pour some boiling water into the saucepan, which the peppers are sitting in, making sure not to pour it over the peppers. The water should come up to about half the height of the peppers. Put a lid on, turn the hob onto a medium heat and let them simmer for 30 -45 minutes until the peppers have softened.Like this recipe?

75g Sukrin Sesame Flour
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp sea salt","Soak the nuts (and seeds if using) overnight with the salt.
(Whole nuts can cause digestive issues for some, which is largely due to their phytate content, an anti-nutrient that removes essential minerals from the body, and is found in grains, nuts and seeds. Soaking them and gently roasting them as we do in this recipe removes the phytates, thus making them more digestible and much safer to eat. Adding sesame or peanut flour adds extra yum plus protein, and they are free from sugar which makes them low carb too.)Drain and rinse the soaked nuts well.
Place on a baking sheet and roast at GM4/350F/180C for 12-15 mins, checking and stirring regularly. Cool.
Roughly chop half the nuts.Process the rest until they begin to form a paste.

You can now stir the marinara sauce into the pan with the aubergines and lower the heat, so it can bubble away while the spaghetti cooks.
Around 5 minutes before the pasta is ready spoon some of the pasta cooking water into the sauce until you have a consistency you’re happy with. The aubergines suck up a lot of the sauce, so this helps to loosen it all up again.
Once the spaghetti is ready drain it and add it to the sauce. Give it all a nice stir and spoon into bowls. To serve, dot the pesto around the bowl and sprinkle on some fresh basil.",https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spaghetti-2-400x267.jpg,0,357

1 tablespoon ground chia seeds
2 tablespoons hot water
2 tablespoons non-dairy milk 
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, Grade B or dark amber 
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
5 tablespoons organic granulated sugar, plus 1/3 to 1/2 cup for shaping
2 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1/3 cup gluten-free chocolate chunks","Note: You don’t need skill but you do need extra time to make these cookies: Make sure you allow 30 minutes for whisking and allowing the dough to thicken. And remember when using melted coconut oil, all the other ingredients need to be at room temperature or the oil will harden into lumps during mixing.Makes 1 dozen cookiesPosition a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place a wire mesh strainer over a medium bowl. Add the baking mix, cocoa, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder to the strainer and stir with a whisk to sift the ingredients into the bowl. (If any small bits remain in the strainer, add them to the mixture in the bowl.) Add the pepper if using; whisk to aerate the mixture, and set aside.
Make the chia gel: Put the ground chia seeds into a small bowl. Pour the hot water over the chia and set aside for 1 minute. Whisk for 30 seconds. (The paste will be thick.)
Whisk the nondairy milk into the chia paste until combined. Let sit for 5 minutes and whisk again. Whisk in the maple syrup and vanilla until combined. Let sit for 5 minutes and whisk again.
Add 5 tablespoons of the sugar and whisk vigorously for 1 minute to “cream” the sugar. Add the coconut oil and whisk until thoroughly incorporated. Add to the dry ingredients and mix with a silicone spatula until no traces of dry ingredients remain.
Mix the chocolate chunks into the dough—it will be shiny and thick but soft. Set aside for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature to allow the dough to thicken, stirring every five minutes.
Shape the cookies: Put 1/3 cup of the remaining sugar into a shallow dish. Scoop the dough in a measuring tablespoon and push off into the sugar with a teaspoon. Roll the pieces in the sugar until thoroughly coated. Add more sugar as needed. Lift the cookies onto the parchment-lined baking sheet, placing them 2 inches apart. Press to flatten.
Place the baking sheet into the oven; immediately reduce the heat to 350°F, and bake for 11 minutes until the cookies are puffed and set. The cookies are soft when they come out of the oven but will firm as they cool.
Place the baking sheet on a wire rack. Wait 10 minutes until the cookies are cool, then run a spatula underneath to release.Serving:Cold cookies offer up the crunch of hardened chocolate chunks, and warm cookies are gooey.
Keeping:Store the cookies in a covered tin or jar, layers separated by parchment, for up to two days. Freeze for up to one month.

Trim the ends from the carrots and core the apple, finely grate both – I don’t worry about peeling either the apple or carrots (though I do give them a good scrub first) but please, feel free to peel both if you want to.
Spoon the apple puree into the syrup mixture and stir together, sift over the flour, baking powder and mixed spice and fold together. Next, add the grated apple, carrot and the ground flaxseed and fold together until completely combined and fragrant. Pour the cake mixture into the prepared tin and then bake in the oven for 1 hour – 1 hour 10 minutes or until risen and golden and firm to the touch.
Leave the cake to cool in its tin for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Place the icing sugar into a mixing bowl and add the lemon juice, bit by bit, until the desired consistency. Spread over the cake and scatter over the lemon and orange zest.

Cider or white wine or rice wine vinegar – ½ teaspoon
Onion powder – 1 teaspoon
Garlic powder – 1 teaspoon
Potato starch – 1 heaped tablespoon (or corn starch – 1.5 heaped teaspoon)

","1. Peel the sweet potato, dice into cubes, and boil for ten minutes or until soft. When ready, drain.
2. Whilst the sweet potato is boiling, put the rest of the ingredients into a blender or Nutribullet, starting with the wet ingredients, then adding the dry ones. Add your cooked sweet potato when ready.
3. Blend until smooth and creamy.
4. At this point, set aside any sauce you don’t want to use right away and pop in the fridge or freezer.
5. To cook the sauce, pour into a non-stick saucepan or frying pan on a medium heat. Cook for 3-5 minutes until the sauce thickens and is hot but not boiling, then turn the heat down as it thickens. Make sure to stir continually with a flat bottomed spatula to stop anything sticking to the pan.
6. When the sauce is thick and silky like a custard, take off the heat and add it to your favourite recipe immediately! (We like to pour over cooked macaroni, add a herby breadcrumb crumb and bake for 20 minutes in the oven for an easy and delicious mac n cheeze.)

2. Putthe coconut oil into a ramekin and melt it in the oven.

6. Using your thumb, flatten each cookie ball gentlyand sprinkle a couple of flakes of the pink salt into each thumb print.
7. Cook for no more than 12 minutes, you don’t want burnt chocolate!
I like to wait for these to cool down a little before tucking in, and I storethem in the fridge. For an extra treat (although not a guilty one) fill the thumb prints with sometoffee cashew cream. Yum!

833,Rainbow Veg Rolls with Peanut Dipping Sauce,"100g dried cellophane noodles
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 pack rice paper wrappers
1 large bunch of coriander, leaves picked
1 small bunch of mint, leaves picked
½ cucumber, halved and seeds scraped out with the tip of a teaspoon, then cut into very thin strips
2 carrots, peeled and cut into very thin strips
1 red pepper, cored, deseeded and cut into very thin strips
6 radishes, very thinly sliced
5–6 spring onions, cut into very thin strips
1 avocado, stoned, peeled and cut into very thin strips
For the Peanut Sauce
4 tablespoons smooth or chunky peanut butter
4 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 tablespoon light brown soft sugar
pinch of dried chilli flakes
","1. Start by making the peanut sauce. Measure all the ingredients into a small saucepan, place over a low heat and heat, stirring continuously, until the mixture just begins to bubble. Remove from the heat and set aside.
2. Place the noodles in a heatproof bowl, pour over boiling water to cover and leave to soak for 10 minutes until rehydrated. Drain well and return to the dried-out bowl. Drizzle over the sesame oil and toss the noodles to evenly coat in the oil.
3. Fill a separate bowl with hot water. Take a rice paper wrapper and dip in the hot water for about 5 seconds until soft and pliable – they really don’t need long.
4. Lay the wrapper on a board and, working quickly, arrange some of the herb leaves down the centre of the wrapper. Then take a little of each of the thinly cut vegetables to create a neat pile in the centre of the wrapper. Finally, place a small bundle of rehydrated noodles on the very top of the veg. Fold in the edges of the wrapper over the veggies and then roll up.
5. Repeat with the remaining wrappers, herbs, veg and noodles.
6. Cut each roll in half to expose the pretty rainbow colours of the vegetables and serve with the warm peanut sauce.
