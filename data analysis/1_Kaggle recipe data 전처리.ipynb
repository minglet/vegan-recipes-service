Knead and stretch the dough the whole time – if your arms start to ache, just image the amazing workout you’re giving them without stepping inside a gym!\\nOnce the timer goes off, shape into a ball, put into a deep bowl that’s had a light sprinkling of flour on the bottom, cover with cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.\\nOnce rested, take it out of the bowl and knead again for 10 seconds – this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten.\\nDivide into 2 equally sized, smooth balls of dough and put into a deep baking dish, lightly sprinkled with flour. Make sure the dish is big enough for them to spread up to twice their size because as the gluten relaxes, they will spread to some degree.\\n* Top Tip *\\nI’ve made this base numerous times and sometimes the dough spreads a lot, other times it hardly spreads at all. Don’t worry, it’s always tasted great either way!\\nLeave to rest at room temperature overnight, or if you’re in a massive hurry, at least eight hours! I don’t leave mine in a very warm place like the airing cupboard as I found it can dry out and form a ‘skin’ on the outside.\\n* Top Tip *\\nThe resting time for the dough is ideally 24 hours, but 48 hours is maximum.\\nPut the normal blade back into your food processor and add in the tomatoes, onion, garlic and ancho poblano, pulse for 10-20 seconds to break them up into small chunks, and pour into your frying pan.\\n* Top Tip *\\nYou can choose how chunky or smooth to have the sauce when pulsing in the processor. Personally I prefer it chunky as it almost becomes one of the delicious pizza toppings.\\nAdd the water, balsamic and simmer on a medium heat for 12-15 mins to let the flavours intensify, while stirring occasionally. It’s ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it’s still moist; don’t let it dry out and stick to the pan.\\n* Top Tip *\\nThe sauce flavours will develop the longer you leave it, so why not make it a couple of days in advance and keep in the fridge? It does however, also tastes great if you make it on the day.\\nTurn the oven on to the highest setting to heat up your pizza stone if you have one, otherwise 220c if you’re using a pizza tray.\\n* Top Tip *\\nFor pizza stones, it’s always the hotter the better, so I usually pre-heat mine for an hour.\\nLightly flour your surface, roll out the dough, add sauce and your favourite tasty toppings. Put into the oven for approx. 8 mins on the pizza stone. I haven’t cooked them on a pizza tray before, but as it won’t have the intense heat of the stone, I’d suggest 10-12 mins (keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t overcook on top).\\n* Serving Suggestion *\\nThese chilli pizzas are a spicy alternative to your usual takeaway version – the base has a delicious hot and smokey bite to it, yet this is balanced perfectly by the sweet flavours of the tomato sauce. Throw a pizza party and impress your friends with your cooking skills, or snuggle up on the sofa with your loved one and enjoy all to yourselves!\\nI honestly don’t miss cheese on pizza once I throw on a mix of veggies, Dee’s vegan sausage and lots of hot, sweet roquito peppers – what’s on your list of ultimate pizza toppings?\\n'"
